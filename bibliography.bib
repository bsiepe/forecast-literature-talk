  abstract = {In low-dimensional data and within the framework of a classical linear regression model, we intend to compare variable selection methods and investigate the role of shrinkage of regression estimates in a simulation study. Our primary aim is to build descriptive models that capture the data structure parsimoniously, while our secondary aim is to derive a prediction model. Simulation studies are an important tool in statistical methodology research if they are well designed, executed, and reported. However, bias in favor of an “own” preferred method is prevalent in most simulation studies in which a new method is proposed and compared with existing methods. To overcome such bias, neutral comparison studies, which disregard the superiority or inferiority of a particular method, have been proposed. In this paper, we designed a simulation study with key principles of neutral comparison studies in mind, though certain unintentional biases cannot be ruled out. To improve the design and reporting of a simulation study, we followed the recently proposed ADEMP structure, which entails defining the aims (A), data-generating mechanisms (D), estimand/target of analysis (E), methods (M), and performance measures (P). To ensure the reproducibility of results, we published the protocol before conducting the study. In addition, we presented earlier versions of the design to several experts whose feedback influenced certain aspects of the design. We will compare popular penalized regression methods (lasso, adaptive lasso, relaxed lasso, and nonnegative garrote) that combine variable selection and shrinkage with classical variable selection methods (best subset selection and backward elimination) with and without post-estimation shrinkage of parameter estimates.}

Although research suggests smartphones might be involved, little is known about the momentary association between different patterns of smartphone use and procrastination. In a preregistered study, 221 students (Mage = 20, 55\% female) self-reported procrastination five times a day for 30 days (i.e., experience sampling method) while their smartphone use was continuously monitored (i.e., passive logging). Using dynamic structural equation modeling on 27,151 observations, we estimated momentary within-person associations between procrastination and (a) total smartphone use and use of specific application categories (social media, messaging, browsers, games, and video streaming), (b) notifications, and (c)?smartphone use fragmentation. Procrastination was positively albeit weakly associated with all aforementioned patterns, and associations varied from person to person. Collectively, our findings suggest these popular devices potentially encourage dilatory behavior.},

In its most complete form this measure is a probability density function for future values of the variables of interest. At the same time combinations of forecast densities are being used in order to integrate information coming from several sources like experts, models and large micro-data sets. Given this increased relevance of forecast density combinations, the genesis and evolution of this approach, both inside and outside economics, is explored. A fundamental density combination equation is specified which shows that various frequentist as well as Bayesian approaches give different specific contents to this density. In its most simplistic case, it is a restricted finite mixture, giving fixed equal weights to the various individual densities. The specification of the fundamental density combination is made more flexible in recent literature. It has evolved from using simple average weights to optimized weights and then to ‘richer’ procedures that allow for time-variation, learning features and model incompleteness. The recent history and evolution of forecast density combination methods, together with their potential and benefits, are illustrated in a policy making environment of central banks.},

  abstract = {Much of recent affect research relies on intensive longitudinal studies to assess daily emotional experiences. The resulting data are analyzed with dynamic models to capture regulatory processes involved in emotional functioning. Daily contexts, however, are commonly ignored. This may not only result in biased parameter estimates and wrong conclusions, but also ignores the opportunity to investigate contextual effects on emotional dynamics. With fixed moderated time series analysis, we present an approach that resolves this problem by estimating context-dependent change in dynamic parameters in single-subject time series models. The approach examines parameter changes of known shape and thus addresses the problem of observed intra-individual heterogeneity (e.g., changes in emotional dynamics due to observed changes in daily stress). In comparison to existing approaches to unobserved heterogeneity, model estimation is facilitated and different forms of change can readily be accommodated. We demonstrate the approach’s viability given relatively short time series by means of a simulation study. In addition, we present an empirical application, targeting the joint dynamics of affect and stress and how these co-vary with daily events. We discuss potentials and limitations of the approach and close with an outlook on the broader implications for understanding emotional adaption and development.},

We also provide an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate jointly the two causal structures and the parameters of the reduced-form VAR model. The BGVAR approach is shown to be quite effective in dealing with model identification and selection in multivariate time series of moderate dimension, as those considered in the economic literature. In the macroeconomic application the BGVAR identifies the relevant structural relationships among 20 US economic variables, thus providing a useful tool for policy analysis. The financial application contributes to the recent econometric literature on financial interconnectedness. The BGVAR approach provides evidence of a strong unidirectional linkage from financial to non-financial super-sectors during the 2007–2009 financial crisis and a strong bidirectional linkage between the two sectors during the 2010–2013 European sovereign debt crisis.},

  abstract = {. Recent studies have shown that emotion dynamics such as inertia (i.e., autocorrelation) can change over time. Importantly, current methods can only detect either gradual or abrupt changes in inertia. This means that researchers have to choose a priori whether they expect the change in inertia to be gradual or abrupt. This will leave researchers in the dark regarding when and how the change in inertia occurred. Therefore in this article, we use a new model: the time-varying change point autoregressive (TVCP-AR) model. The TVCP-AR model can detect both gradual and abrupt changes in emotion dynamics. More specifically, we show that the inertia of positive affect and negative affect measured in one individual differs qualitatively in how it changes over time. Whereas the inertia of positive affect increased only gradually over time, negative affect changed both in a gradual and abrupt fashion over time. This illustrates the necessity of being able to model both gradual and abrupt changes in order to detect meaningful quantitative and qualitative differences in temporal emotion dynamics.},

  abstract = {To investigate whether sleep disturbances are bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression, and thus identify potential risk factors for each problem.A systematic review was conducted on 9 studies (8 longitudinal, 1 retrospective) that assessed bidirectionality between a sleep disturbance, and anxiety or depression. Treatment studies were excluded, along with those solely based on clinical samples or cohorts at high risk of suffering from a sleep disturbance, anxiety and depression. Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, and Scopus databases, and reference lists of eligible studies. Publication dates ranged from the beginning of each database to December 2011.Syntheses of longitudinal studies suggested insomnia and sleep quality were bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression, and depression/anxiety, respectively. Childhood sleep problems significantly predicted higher levels of depression and a combined depression/anxiety variable, but not vice-versa. A one-way relationship was found where anxiety predicted excessive daytime sleepiness, but excessive daytime sleepiness was not associated with depression.Definitive conclusions regarding bidirectionality cannot be made for most sleep disturbances due to the small number and heterogeneity of cohort samples used across studies. Nevertheless, best available evidence suggests insomnia is bidirectionally related to anxiety and depression. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed.},

We do this by presenting fragments from three clinical cases in which the interview material helped us to understand the relational and intrapsychic dynamics of the patients concerned. In the first of these cases, we apply the AAI dimensional concept of coherence to psychotherapy sessions and observe an increase in coherence over time, as well as rely on interviews from the mother and young adult in therapy to explicate the process of intergenerational transmission in the context of early losses in one generation impacting upon the developmental trajectory of the next. The second clinical case involves a young man in which repeated administrations of the interview served to both forecast the course and chart progress observed in therapy. The third case involves a young woman with features of borderline personality disorder. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Recent experimental evidence, using samples of U.S. college students, suggests that this initial elevation phenomenon is due to an upward bias in people’s initial responses. Such bias potentially undermines the validity of many research findings. However, more recent studies have found little evidence in support of the phenomenon. To investigate the robustness of the initial elevation phenomenon, we conducted the largest experiments to date in diverse online samples (N = 5,285 across three studies, from Prolific.co). We observed an initial elevation on self-reports of negative subjective experiences such as mood and mental and physical health symptoms. Our findings show that the threats to validity posed by the phenomenon are real and need to be reckoned with.},

The interdisciplinary research area and conflicting evidence from primary studies complicate the assessment of current scholarly knowledge in this field of high public attention. We review meta-analytic evidence on three hotly debated topics regarding the effects of SNSs: well-being, academic achievement, and narcissism. Meta-analyses from different laboratories draw a rather equivocal picture. They show small associations in the r = .10 range between the intensity of SNS use and loneliness, self-esteem, life satisfaction, or self-reported depression, and somewhat stronger links to a thin body ideal and higher social capital. There is no indication for potential devastating effects of social media on school achievement; social media use and school grades are unrelated for adolescents. The meta-analyses revealed small to moderate associations between narcissism and SNS use. In sum, meta-analytic evidence is not in support of dramatic claims relating social media use to mischief.},

Recent applications in the field of psychosomatic research have provided insights into the dynamical nature of the relationship between somatic symptoms, physiological measures, and emotional states. These promising results highlight the intrinsic value of employing time series analysis, although application comes with some important challenges. This paper aims to present an approachable, non-technical overview of the state of the art on these challenges and the solutions that have been proposed, with emphasis on application towards psychosomatic hypotheses. Specifically, we elaborate on issues related to measurement intervals, the number and nature of the variables used in the analysis, modeling stable and changing processes, concurrent relationships, and extending time series analysis to incorporate the data of multiple individuals. We also briefly discuss some general modeling issues, such as lag-specification, sample size and time series length, and the role of measurement errors. We hope to arm applied researchers with an overview from which to select appropriate techniques from the ever growing variety of time series analysis approaches.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Although screening for unipolar depression is controversial, it is potentially an efficient way to find undetected cases and improve diagnostic acumen. Using a reference standard, we aimed to validate the 2- and 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9) in primary care settings. The PHQ-2 comprises the first 2 questions of the PHQ-9. METHODS Consecutive adult patients attending Auckland family practices completed the PHQ-9, after which they completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) depression reference standard. Sensitivities and specificities for PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 were analyzed. RESULTS There were 2,642 patients who completed both the PHQ-9 and the CIDI. Sensitivity and specificity of the PHQ-2 for diagnosing major depression were 86\% and 78\%, respectively, with a score of 2 or higher and 61\% and 92\% with a score 3 or higher; for the PHQ-9, they were 74\% and 91\%, respectively, with a score of 10 or higher. For the PHQ-2 a score of 2 or higher detected more cases of depression than a score of 3 or higher. For the PHQ-9 a score of 10 or higher detected more cases of major depression than the PHQ determination of major depression originally described by Spitzer et al in 1999. CONCLUSIONS We report the largest validation study of the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9, compared with a reference standard interview, undertaken in an exclusively primary care population. The PHQ-2 score or 2 or higher had good sensitivity but poor specificity in detecting major depression. Using a PHQ-2 threshold score of 2 or higher rather than 3 or higher resulted in more depressed patients being correctly identified. A PHQ-9 score of 10 or higher appears to detect more depressed patients than the originally described PHQ-9 scoring for major depression.},

This study examined whether cognitive– behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) delivered by a therapist compared with self-help CBT-I (written materials only) reduces insomnia and depression severity in individuals with comorbid insomnia and depression. A total of 41 participants (18 – 64 years; 25 females) with comorbid depression and insomnia, treated with antidepressants for at least 6 weeks, were randomized to receive 4 sessions of either CBT-I or self-help CBT-I over 8 weeks. Insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II]) were assessed at baseline, following each session, and at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were sleep quality and duration (actigraphy and diaries), anxiety, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness. Compared with self-help CBT-I, BDI-II scores in the CBT-I group dropped by 11.93 (95\% confidence interval [CI] [6.60, 17.27], p Ͻ .001) more points, and ISI scores dropped by 6.59 (95\% CI [3.04, 10.15], p ϭ .001) more points across treatment. At 3-month follow-up, 61.1\% of CBT-I participants were in clinical remission from their insomnia and depression, compared with 5.6\% of the self-help group. Conclusions: CBT-I administered by a therapist produced significant reductions in both insomnia and depression severity posttreatment and at follow-up, compared with a control condition in which participants received only written CBT-I material. Targeting insomnia through CBT-I is efficacious for treating comorbid insomnia and depression, and should be considered an important adjunct therapy for patients with depression whose symptoms have not remitted through antidepressant treatment.},

The daily associations between sleep and physical activity have been examined in observational or interventional contexts. The primary goal of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize existing evidence about daily associations between sleep and physical activity outcomes at inter- and intra-individual level in adults. A systematic search of records in eight databases from inception to July 2019 identified 33 peer-reviewed empirical publications that examined daily sleep–physical activity association in adults. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of included studies did not support a bidirectional daily association between sleep outcomes and physical activity. Multilevel meta-analyses showed that three sleep parameters were associated with physical activity the following day: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset. However, the associations were small, and varied in terms of direction and level of variability (e.g., inter- or intra-individual). Daytime physical activity was associated with lower total sleep time the following night at an inter-person level with a small effect size. From a clinical perspective, care providers should monitor the effects of better sleep promotion on physical activity behaviors in their patients. Future studies should examine sleep and physical activity during a longer period and perform additional sophisticated statistical analyses. Systematic review registration https://osf.io/w6uy5/.},

This may impact adversely on patients through longer admissions and sub-optimal pharmacotherapy. Psychomotor speed is a prominent neuropsychological function which changes as recovery occurs. This study examines simple techniques used to quantify psychomotor change and their potential to contribute to monitoring recovery.Methods:Activity levels were continuously monitored in patients diagnosed with a major depressive episode from four acute psychiatric wards using two actigraphs (commercial and scientific) for 3?weeks and linear regression used to calculate a gradient to express rate of change. Psychomotor speed was assessed using the simple Coin Rotation Task. Mood and functioning were rated using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, Clinical Global Impression Scale and Functioning Assessment Short Test. The assessments were completed at baseline and follow-up (3?weeks), and correlations were calculated for all change measures.Results:In all, 24 inpatients were recruited but not all completed baseline and follow-up measures. Change in activity count (N?=?16) and psychomotor speed (N?=?13) correlated significantly with improvement in clinical measures of depressive symptoms. Actigraphs were acceptable to hospital inpatients.Limitations:The limited size of this pilot study precludes the analysis of predictive power or the influence of other variables such as depression subtypes, age, gender or variations related to medications.Conclusion:Early change in simple activity and psychomotor speed warrant further investigation for utility in measuring treatment response in depressed inpatients.},

Several studies have raised the question whether insomniac symptoms may constitute an independent clinical predictor of depression. This meta-analysis is aimed at evaluating quantitatively if insomnia constitutes a predictor of depression. Methods PubMed, Medline, PsycInfo, and PsycArticles databases were searched from 1980 until 2010 to identify longitudinal epidemiological studies simultaneously investigating insomniac complaints and depressed psychopathology. Effects were summarized using the logarithms of the odds ratios for insomnia at baseline to predict depression at follow-up. Studies were pooled with both fixed- and random-effects meta-analytic models in order to evaluate the concordance. Heterogeneity test and sensitivity analysis were computed. Results Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. Considering all studies together, heterogeneity was found. The random-effects model showed an overall odds ratio for insomnia to predict depression of 2.60 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.98–3.42). When the analysis was adjusted for outliers, the studies were not longer heterogeneous. The fixed-effects model showed an overall odds ratio of 2.10 (CI: 1.86–2.38). Limitations The main limit is that included studies did not always consider the role of other intervening variables. Conclusions Non-depressed people with insomnia have a twofold risk to develop depression, compared to people with no sleep difficulties. Thus, early treatment programs for insomnia might reduce the risk for developing depression in the general population and be considered a helpful general preventive strategy in the area of mental health care.},

  abstract = {Investigating sleep in mental disorders has the potential to reveal both disorder-specific and transdiagnostic psychophysiological mechanisms. This meta-analysis aimed at determining the polysomnographic (PSG) characteristics of several mental disorders., Relevant studies were searched through standard strategies. Controlled PSG studies evaluating sleep in affective, anxiety, eating, pervasive developmental, borderline and antisocial personality disorders, ADHD, and schizophrenia were included. PSG variables of sleep continuity, depth, and architecture, as well as rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep were considered. Calculations were performed with the “Comprehensive Meta-Analysis” and “R” softwares. Using random effects modeling, for each disorder and each variable, a separate meta-analysis was conducted if at least 3 studies were available for calculation of effect sizes as standardized means (Hedges’g). Sources of variability, i.e., sex, age, and mental disorders comorbidity, were evaluated in subgroup analyses., Sleep alterations were evidenced in all disorders, with the exception of ADHD and seasonal affective disorders. Sleep continuity problems were observed in most mental disorders. Sleep depth and REM pressure alterations were associated with affective, anxiety, autism and schizophrenia disorders. Comorbidity was associated with enhanced REM sleep pressure and more inhibition of sleep depth. No sleep parameter was exclusively altered in one condition; however, no two conditions shared the same PSG profile., Sleep continuity disturbances imply a transdiagnostic imbalance in the arousal system likely representing a basic dimension of mental health. Sleep depth and REM variables might play a key role in psychiatric comorbidity processes. Constellations of sleep alterations may define distinct disorders better than alterations in one single variable.},

This study aimed to explore the use of this manualized parent–infant psychotherapy group model in an African setting with high-risk mother–infant dyads, and describes the implementation and investigation of this 12-week group psychotherapy intervention in two Johannesburg shelters for homeless women. The measures used to investigate treatment efficacy were the Parent Development Interview (A. Slade, J.L. Aber, I. Bresgi, B. Berger, \& M. Kaplan, ), the Emotional Availability Scales (Z. Biringen, J.L. Robinson, \& R.N. Emde, ), the Kessler-10 (R.C. Kessler et al., ), and the Griffiths Scales of Mental Development (D. Luiz et al., ). At pretesting, infants exhibited delays in a number of developmental areas, and mothers showed high levels of depression and generally low capacities for reflective function. While significant shifts in the mothers’ capacities for reflective function were not found in the treatment condition, significant shifts were found in the infants’ speech abilities and in the mothers’ abilities to structure their interactions with their infants. This suggests that the program enabled mothers to become more sensitized to their infants’ needs in interaction and that communication between mother and infant increased. The number of sessions attended by the dyads correlated with improvements made by the mothers and their infants.},

Modern regularization methods such as lasso regression have recently been introduced in the field and are incorporated into popular methodologies, such as network analysis. However, several recognized limitations of lasso regularization may limit its suitability for psychological research. In this paper, we compare the properties of lasso approaches used for variable selection to Bayesian variable selection approaches. In particular we highlight advantages of stochastic search variable selection (SSVS), that make it well suited for variable selection applications in psychology. We demonstrate these advantages and contrast SSVS with lasso type penalization in~an application to predict depression symptoms in a large sample and an accompanying~simulation study.~We investigate the effects of sample size, effect size, and patterns of correlation among predictors on rates of correct and false inclusion and bias in the estimates. SSVS as investigated here is reasonably computationally efficient and powerful to detect moderate effects in small sample sizes (or small effects in moderate sample sizes), while protecting against false inclusion and without over-penalizing true effects. We recommend SSVS as a flexible framework that is well-suited for the field, discuss limitations, and suggest directions for future development.},

We further extend the SSGL to sparse generalized additive models (GAMs), thereby introducing the first nonparametric variant of the spike-and-slab lasso methodology. Our model simultaneously performs group selection and estimation, while our fully Bayes treatment of the mixture proportion allows for model complexity control and automatic self-adaptivity to different levels of sparsity. We develop theory to uniquely characterize the global posterior mode under the SSGL and introduce a highly efficient block coordinate ascent algorithm for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We further employ de-biasing methods to provide uncertainty quantification of our estimates. Thus, implementation of our model avoids the computational intensiveness of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in high dimensions. We derive posterior concentration rates for both grouped linear regression and sparse GAMs when the number of covariates grows at nearly exponential rate with sample size. Finally, we illustrate our methodology through extensive simulations and data analysis.},

In a series of analyses on the distributions of the AAI classifications in various cultural and age groups, fathers, and high-risk and clinical samples, we used the distribution of the combined samples of North American non-clinical mothers (23\% dismissing, 58\% secure, 19\% preoccupied attachment representations, and 18\% additionally coded for unresolved loss or other trauma) to examine deviations from this normative pattern, through multinomial tests and analyses of correspondence. The analyses were restricted to AAI classifications coded according to the Main, Goldwyn, and Hesse (2003) system. We did not find gender differences in the use of dismissing versus preoccupied attachment strategies, and the AAI distributions were largely independent of language and country of origin. Clinical subjects showed more insecure and unresolved attachment representations than the norm groups. Disorders with an internalizing dimension (e.g., borderline personality disorders) were associated with more preoccupied and unresolved attachments, whereas disorders with an externalizing dimension (e.g., antisocial personality disorders) displayed more dismissing as well as preoccupied attachments. Depressive symptomatology was associated with insecurity but not with unresolved loss or trauma, whereas adults with abuse experiences or PTSD were mostly unresolved. In order to find more reliable associations with clinical symptoms and disorders, future AAI studies may make more fruitful use of continuous AAI scales in addition to the conventionally used categorical classifications.},

Despite its exciting potential, the stability and replicability of DSEM is yet to be closely examined. This study empirically investigates DSEM using recently published data to explore its strengths and potential limitations. The results show that while some of its parameter estimates are stable, others are characterized by substantial variation as a function of seemingly innocuous initial model estimation conditions. Indeed, some parameters fluctuate between significance and non-significance for the same model estimated using the same data. The instability of DSEM estimates poses a serious threat to the internal and external validity of conclusions drawn from its analyses, challenging the reproducibility of findings from applied research. Given the recent focus on the replication crisis in psychology, it is critical to address these issues as the popularity of DSEM in psychological research continues to rise. Several potential solutions are investigated to address this problem and recommendations of best practice are offered to applied researchers who plan to use DSEM in intensive longitudinal data analysis.},

This perspective is placed in the context of the enormous progress in refining methodologies for psychotherapy research over that period of time, resulting in the clear demonstration of positive effects from psychological treatments for many disorders and problems. The study of negative effects—whether due to techniques, client variables, therapist variables, or some combination of these—has not been accorded the same degree of attention. Indeed, methodologies suitable for ascertaining positive effects often obscure negative effects in the absence of specific strategies for explicating these outcomes. Greater emphasis on more individual idiographic approaches to studying the effects of psychological interventions would seem necessary if psychologists are to avoid harming their patients and if they are to better understand the causes of negative or iatrogenic effects from their treatment efforts. This would be best carried out in the context of a strong collaboration among frontline clinicians and clinical scientists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In order to model a covariance matrix effectively, it is typically broken down into components based on modeling considerations or mathematical convenience. Decompositions that have received recent research attention include variance components, spectral decomposition, Cholesky decomposition, and matrix logarithm. In this paper we study a statistically motivated decomposition which appears to be relatively unexplored for the purpose of modeling. We model a covariance matrix in terms of its corresponding standard deviations and correlation matrix. We discuss two general modeling situations where this approach is useful: shrinkage estimation of regression coefficients, and a general location-scale model for both categorical and continuous variables. We present some simple choices for priors in terms of standard deviations and the correlation matrix, and describe a straightforward computational strategy for obtaining the posterior of the covariance matrix. We apply our method to real and simulated data sets in the context of shrinkage estimation.},

In this Review, we examine the field of network neuroscience, focusing on organizing principles that can help overcome these challenges. First, we describe the fundamental goals in constructing network models. Second, we review the most common forms of network models, which can be described parsimoniously along the following three primary dimensions: from data representations to first-principles theory; from biophysical realism to functional phenomenology; and from elementary descriptions to coarse-grained approximations. Third, we draw on biology, philosophy and other disciplines to establish validation principles for these models. We close with a discussion of opportunities to bridge model types and point to exciting frontiers for future pursuits.},

  abstract = {Step counting has long been used as a method of measuring distance. Starting in the mid-1900s, researchers became interested in using steps per day to quantify ambulatory physical activity. This line of research gained momentum after 1995, with the introduction of reasonably accurate spring-levered pedometers with digital displays. Since 2010, the use of accelerometer-based “activity trackers” by private citizens has skyrocketed. Steps have several advantages as a metric for assessing physical activity: they are intuitive, easy to measure, objective, and they represent a fundamental unit of human ambulatory activity. However, since they measure a human behavior, they have inherent biological variability; this means that measurements must be made over 3–7~days to attain valid and reliable estimates. There are many different kinds of step counters, designed to be worn on various sites on the body; all of these devices have strengths and limitations. In cross-sectional studies, strong associations between steps per day and health variables have been documented. Currently, at least eight prospective, longitudinal studies using accelerometers are being conducted that may help to establish dose–response relationships between steps/day and health outcomes. Longitudinal interventions using step counters have shown that they can help inactive individuals to increase by 2500 steps per day. Step counting is useful for surveillance, and studies have been conducted in a number of countries around the world. Future challenges include the need to establish testing protocols and accuracy standards, and to decide upon the best placement sites. These challenges should be addressed in order to achieve harmonization between studies, and to accurately quantify dose–response relationships.},

  abstract = {Objective One of the promises of the experience sampling methodology (ESM) is that a statistical analysis of an individual's emotions, cognitions and behaviors in everyday-life could be used to identify relevant treatment targets. A requisite for clinical implementation is that outcomes of such person-specific time-series analyses are not wholly contingent on the researcher performing them. Methods To evaluate this, we crowdsourced the analysis of one individual patient's ESM data to 12 prominent research teams, asking them what symptom(s) they would advise the treating clinician to target in subsequent treatment. Results Variation was evident at different stages of the analysis, from preprocessing steps (e.g., variable selection, clustering, handling of missing data) to the type of statistics and rationale for selecting targets. Most teams did include a type of vector autoregressive model, examining relations between symptoms over time. Although most teams were confident their selected targets would provide useful information to the clinician, not one recommendation was similar: both the number (0–16) and nature of selected targets varied widely. Conclusion This study makes transparent that the selection of treatment targets based on personalized models using ESM data is currently highly conditional on subjective analytical choices and highlights key conceptual and methodological issues that need to be addressed in moving towards clinical implementation.},

It builds on the framework of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM) and stationary time series Gaussian Graphical model (StGM), and complements existing works on parametric graphical models based on change point vector autoregressions (VAR). Analogous to StGM, the proposed framework captures conditional noncorrelations (both intertemporal and contemporaneous) in the form of an undirected graph. In addition, to describe the more nuanced nonstationary relationships among the components of the time series, we introduce the new notion of conditional nonstationarity/stationarity and incorporate it within the graph architecture. This allows one to distinguish between direct and indirect nonstationary relationships among system components, and can be used to search for small subnetworks that serve as the "source" of nonstationarity in a large system. Together, the two concepts of conditional noncorrelation and nonstationarity/stationarity provide a parsimonious description of the dependence structure of the time series.},

Increasingly, patient-provider contacts occur remotely (eg, by telephone and Web-based portals), and mobile health tools can now monitor depressed mood daily or more frequently. However, the reliability and utility of daily ratings are unclear. Objective This study aimed to examine the association between a daily depressive symptom measure and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the most widely adopted depression self-report measure, and compare how well these 2 assessment methods predict patient outcomes. Methods A total of 547 individuals completed smartphone-based measures, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) modified for daily administration, the PHQ-9, and the Sheehan Disability Scale. Multilevel factor analyses evaluated the reliability of latent depression based on the PHQ-2 (for repeated measures) between weeks 2 and 4 and its correlation with the PHQ-9 at week 4. Regression models predicted week 8 depressive symptoms and disability ratings with daily PHQ-2 and PHQ-9. Results The daily PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 are highly reliable (range: 0.80-0.88) and highly correlated (r=.80). Findings were robust across demographic groups (age, gender, and ethnic minority status). Daily PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 were comparable in predicting week 8 disability and were independent predictors of week 8 depressive symptoms and disability, though the unique contribution of the PHQ-2 was small in magnitude. Conclusions Daily completion of the PHQ-2 is a reasonable proxy for the PHQ-9 and is comparable to the PHQ-9 in predicting future outcomes. Mobile assessment methods offer researchers and clinicians reliable and valid new methods for depression assessment that may be leveraged for measurement-based depression care.},

  abstract = {Background: Early recognition of the prodromal symptoms of bipolar disorder, combined with a patient action plan, may help to prevent relapses. Sleep disturbances are frequent warning signs of both mania and depression. This study used cross correlation analysis to characterize the relationship between mood, sleep and bedrest in longitudinal data. Methods: Self-reported mood, sleep and bedrest (mean 169 ± 59 days of data per patient) from 59 outpatients with bipolar disorder receiving standard treatment were analyzed. The cross correlation function was used to determine the latency between the changes in sleep and/or bedrest and mood for time shifts of between –7 and 7 days. Results: For sleep and/or bedrest, a significant inverse correlation was found with the change in mood, most commonly with a time latency of one day. Sleep plus bedrest had the strongest relationship with a change in mood, with a significant correlation in 24 of 59 patients (41\%) for the night before or night of a mood change. The patients with a significant cross-correlation between mood and sleep plus bedrest reported about two thirds of all large sleep changes of {$>$}3 h and three fourths of all large mood changes ({$>$}20 on 100-unit scale). Patients with a significant cross correlation were more likely to take benzodiazepines. Conclusion: In most patients with a significant cross correlation between sleep and/or bedrest and mood, the mood change occurred on the day following the change in sleep and/or bedrest. Sleep changes from a previous pattern, especially those of more than 3 h, may indicate that a large mood change is imminent.},

  abstract = {Childhood trauma confers higher risk of adulthood physical and mental illness; however, the biological mechanism mediating this association remains largely unknown. Recent research has suggested dysregulation of the immune system as a possible biological mediator. The present paper conducted a meta-analysis to establish whether early-life adversity contributes to potentially pathogenic pro-inflammatory phenotypes in adult individuals. A systematic search of Pubmed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus and Medline identified 25 articles for the meta-analysis, including 18 studies encompassing a sample of 16\,870 individuals for C-reactive protein (CRP), 15 studies including 3751 individuals for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 10 studies including 881 individuals for tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Random-effects meta-analysis showed that individuals exposed to childhood trauma had significantly elevated baseline peripheral levels of CRP (Fisher’s z=0.10, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=0.05–0.14), IL-6 (z=0.08, 95\% CI=0.03–0.14) and TNF-α (z=0.23, 95\% CI=0.14–0.32). Subgroup analyses for specific types of trauma (sexual, physical or emotional abuse) revealed that these impact differentially the single inflammatory markers. Moreover, meta-regression revealed greater effect sizes in clinical samples for the association between childhood trauma and CRP but not for IL-6 or TNF-α. Age, body mass index (BMI) and gender had no moderating effects. The analysis demonstrates that childhood trauma contributes to a pro-inflammatory state in adulthood, with specific inflammatory profiles depending on the specific type of trauma.},

Relatively understudied, however, is the nature of rumination across time and how individual differences in the temporal dynamics of rumination may be related to depression. In this study, we investigated the association between ruminative inertia (the degree to which rumination levels are resistant to change from day to day) and both current and past depression in a clinical sample. Participants (N = 71) completed daily-diary surveys for 3 weeks. Ruminative inertia was positively associated with current depressive symptoms and negatively associated with the number of past depressive episodes. These findings suggest that more severe depressive symptoms are associated with rumination that is more resistant to change over time, whereas a greater number of past depressive episodes is related to less ruminative inertia. Additional research is needed to explore the directionality of these effects.},

  abstract = {The study of personality development primarily focuses on between-person, nomothetic assessments of personality using assessments of personality traits. An alternative approach uses individual, idiographic personality assessment, defining personality in reference to one’s self rather than to others. Nomothetic approaches to personality development identify high levels of consistency in personality, even over decades. But the developmental pattern of idiographic personality is unclear, partially due to difficulties in assessing personality idiographically. We examine a number of traditional and novel idiographic modeling techniques using two years of ESM data from the Personality and Interpersonal Roles Study (PAIRS; N = 372 participants, total assessments N = 17,715). We computed idiographic lagged (lag 1 autoregressive) and contemporaneous (concurrent) graphical VAR models, as well as several other idiographic models, for each subject at the individual level at both waves, which are represented as networks. The utility and interpretation of these newer idiographic personality models at an individual level is demonstrated by using two example subjects. Across all participants, idiographic personality models were heterogeneous in structure, indicating the value of an idiographic approach. Contemporaneous, but not lagged, idiographic models were consistent over time. Despite normative levels of consistency, both types of idiographic models exhibited a great range of individual differences in consistency where some people were completely stable across two years whereas others were very unlike their former selves. In sum, we demonstrate that novel idiographic modeling techniques provide a useful tool to address questions of personality dynamics that were not possible with more traditional idiographic assessments.},

Rather than pitting persons against situations, such an approach allows psychological phenomena, situations, and time to jointly predict future behaviors and experiences.

Studies on momentary cognitive and affective states and their interplay during daily life over the menstrual cycle in affected women are still lacking.

Results revealed that women with PMDD showed significant increases in negative affect and rumination and decreases in positive affect and self-acceptance toward the end of the cycle. Lagged analyses demonstrated stronger within-person reciprocal effects of cognitions and mood in PMDD women compared to controls with the effect of rumination on subsequent negative affect being limited to the late luteal phase. Identified stronger prospective associations between cognitive processes and mood deteriorations in women with PMDD suggest that affected women are more sensitive to detrimental effects of either dimension. Hence, therapeutic strategies aiming at reducing ruminative thoughts and improving self-acceptance such as mindfulness-based interventions could be promising for reducing the burden of PMDD.},

  abstract = {Medicine, even from the earliest days of artificial intelligence (AI) research, has been one of the most inspiring and promising domains for the application of AI-based approaches. Equally, it has been one of the more challenging areas to see an effective adoption. There are many reasons for this, primarily the reluctance to delegate decision making to machine intelligence in cases where patient safety is at stake. To address some of these challenges, medical AI, especially in its modern data-rich deep learning guise, needs to develop a principled and formal uncertainty quantification (UQ) discipline, just as we have seen in fields such as nuclear stockpile stewardship and risk management. The data-rich world of AI-based learning and the frequent absence of a well-understood underlying theory poses its own unique challenges to straightforward adoption of UQ. These challenges, while not trivial, also present significant new research opportunities for the development of new theoretical approaches, and for the practical applications of UQ in the area of machine-assisted medical decision making. Understanding prediction system structure and defensibly quantifying uncertainty is possible, and, if done, can significantly benefit both research and practical applications of AI in this critical domain.},

To efficiently explore high-dimensional and often continuous ML search spaces, we model the multiverse with a Gaussian Process surrogate and apply Bayesian experimental design. Our framework is designed to facilitate drawing robust scientific conclusions about model performance, and thus our approach focuses on exploration rather than conventional optimization. In the first of two case studies, we investigate disputed claims about the relative merit of adaptive optimizers. Second, we synthesize conflicting research on the effect of learning rate on the large batch training generalization gap.

At baseline, physical activity was measured using accelerometers. At follow-up, mental wellbeing was measured using the ‘Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale’ (WEMWBS) and symptoms of mental health disorder using the ‘Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire’ (SDQ). Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to investigate associations between physical activity and both mental wellbeing and symptoms of mental health disorder. Results: 794 (86\%) of the eligible 928 young people provided valid accelerometer data at baseline. 668 (72\%) provided complete mental wellbeing data and 673 (73\%) provided complete symptoms of mental health disorder data at follow-up. The multivariable analyses showed no evidence of an association between physical activity volume (counts per minute (cpm)) or intensity (Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA)) and mental wellbeing (WEMWBS overall score) or overall symptoms of mental health disorder (SDQ Total Difficulties Score). However, higher levels of physical activity volume at age 12–13 years were associated with lower scores on the emotional problems subscale of the SDQ at age 15–16 years. Conclusions: This cohort study found no strong evidence that physical activity is associated with better mental wellbeing or reduced symptoms of mental health disorder in adolescents. However, a protective association between physical activity and the emotional problems subscale of the SDQ was found. This suggests that physical activity has the potential to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents. Future cohort study designs should allow for repeated measures to fully explore the temporal nature of any relationship.},

  abstract = {The nomothetic approach (i.e., the study of interindividual variation) dominates analyses of clinical data, even though its assumption of homogeneity across people and time is often violated. The idiographic approach (i.e., the study of intraindividual variation) is best suited for analyses of heterogeneous clinical data, but its person-specific methods and results have been criticized as unwieldy. Group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME) combines the assets of the nomothetic and idiographic approaches by creating person-specific maps that contain a group-level structure. The maps show how intensively measured variables predict and are predicted by each other at different time scales. In this article, GIMME is introduced conceptually and mathematically, and then applied to an empirical data set containing the negative affect, detachment, disinhibition, and hostility composite ratings from the daily diaries of 25 individuals with personality pathology. Results are discussed with the aim of elucidating GIMME?s potential for clinical research and practice.},

  abstract = {Structural vector autoregressive models (VARs) hold great potential for psychological science, particularly for time series data analysis. They capture the magnitude, direction of influence, and temporal (lagged and contemporaneous) nature of relations among variables. Unified structural equation modeling (uSEM) is an optimal structural VAR instantiation, according to large-scale simulation studies, and it is implemented within an SEM framework. However, little is known about the uniqueness of uSEM results. Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate whether multiple solutions result from uSEM analysis and, if so, to demonstrate ways to select an optimal solution. This was accomplished with two simulated data sets, an empirical data set concerning children’s dyadic play, and modifications to the group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME) program, which implements uSEMs with groupand individual-level relations in a data-driven manner. Results revealed multiple solutions when there were large contemporaneous relations among variables. Results also verified several ways to select the correct solution when the complete solution set was generated, such as the use of cross-validation, maximum standardized residuals, and information criteria. This work has immediate and direct implications for the analysis of time series data and for the inferences drawn from those data concerning human behavior.},

However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often replaced by practitioners in favour of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. It is shown that for purely autoregressive models, the use of standard K-fold CV is possible provided the models considered have uncorrelated errors. Such a setup occurs, for example, when the models nest a more appropriate model. This is very common when Machine Learning methods are used for prediction, and where CV can control for overfitting the data. Theoretical insights supporting these arguments are presented, along with a simulation study and a real-world example. It is shown empirically that K-fold CV performs favourably compared to both OOS evaluation and other time-series-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation.},

  abstract = {In time series predictor evaluation, we observe that with respect to the model selection procedure there is a gap between evaluation of traditional forecasting procedures, on the one hand, and evaluation of machine learning techniques on the other hand. In traditional forecasting, it is common practice to reserve a part from the end of each time series for testing, and to use the rest of the series for training. Thus it is not made full use of the data, but theoretical problems with respect to temporal evolutionary effects and dependencies within the data as well as practical problems regarding missing values are eliminated. On the other hand, when evaluating machine learning and other regression methods used for time series forecasting, often cross-validation is used for evaluation, paying little attention to the fact that those theoretical problems invalidate the fundamental assumptions of cross-validation. To close this gap and examine the consequences of different model selection procedures in practice, we have developed a rigorous and extensive empirical study. Six different model selection procedures, based on (i) cross-validation and (ii) evaluation using the series’ last part, are used to assess the performance of four machine learning and other regression techniques on synthetic and real-world time series. No practical consequences of the theoretical flaws were found during our study, but the use of cross-validation techniques led to a more robust model selection. To make use of the “best of both worlds”, we suggest that the use of a blocked form of cross-validation for time series evaluation became the standard procedure, thus using all available information and circumventing the theoretical problems.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives Rumination is strongly associated with risk, maintenance, and worsening of depressive and related symptoms, and it predicts poor treatment response and relapse. More work is needed to clarify the nature and malleability of rumination. We propose reexamining trait rumination as a system of interacting components (“nodes”). Methods A regularized partial correlation network was first computed to estimate the functional relations among items from the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) (N\,=\,403). We then tested whether items constitute multiple distinguishable sub-networks or communities, and if so, if particular items function as “bridges” connecting them. Results RRS items were not interchangeable, with network components varying widely in their centrality. We identified three communities of nodes and the nodes bridging these communities. Limitations Data were derived from a heterogeneous community sample and include items from a single measure. Thus, results should not be interpreted as definitive, but instead as hypothesis-generating and highlighting the utility of rethinking the conceptualization and measurement of rumination. Conclusions Of the larger set of cognitive patterns forming the rumination construct, the high centrality nodes were largely passive and self-critical processes. Community detection analyses identified a sub-network largely comprising items from the RRS that have traditionally been labeled reflective pondering and adaptive; however, strong bridge nodes were also from this community. This implies that in isolation or at low levels such processes may not be problematic, but that their persistence or intensification could be associated with the activation of more maladaptive processes.},

Lewinsohn's cognitive behavioural model of depression assumes a lack of positive experience due to a reduced level of activity as a key aspect of depression. The acute relationship between motor activity and mood as well as between motor activity and incentive drive (the motivation to engage in activities) is unknown. An augmentation of mood and incentive drive could precede or follow motor activity. We examined (1) whether motor activity would be correlated with the course of depression and (2) the temporal relationship between motor activity and acute changes in mood and incentive drive. Motor activity was measured with actigraphy in 12 patients with depression for one week. Severity of depression was assessed before and at the end of the study with depression rating scales. The patients reported mood and incentive drive once per hour. With lag sequential analysis, the temporal relationship between motor activity and mood and incentive drive was evaluated. Higher motor activity was associated with depression improvement. Motor activity had an acute association with mood and incentive drive, especially one hour after activity. The results support the Lewinsohn's model of depression and underline the impact of behavioural activation in antidepressant treatment.},

We sampled adolescents’ experiences six times per day for one week to quantify differences in their susceptibility to the effects of social media on their momentary affective well-being. Rigorous analyses of 2,155 real-time assessments showed that the association between social media use and affective well-being differs strongly across adolescents: While 44\% did not feel better or worse after passive social media use, 46\% felt better, and 10\% felt worse.

It is therefore critical to measure and monitor these states on a large scale and consider correlates. We used novel panel network methodology to explore relationships between internalizing symptoms, well-being, and inter/intrapersonal indicators. A multiverse design was used with 32 conditions to consider the stability of results across arbitrary researcher decisions in a large community sample over three years (N = 15,843, aged 11–12 at Time 1). Networks were consistently similar for girls and boys. Stable trait-like effects within anxiety, attentional, and social indicators were found. Within-person networks were densely connected and suggested mental health and inter/intrapersonal correlates related to one another in similar complex ways. The multiverse design suggested the particular operationalization of items can substantially influence conclusions. Nevertheless, indicators such as thinking clearly, unhappiness, dealing with stress, and worry showed more consistent centrality, suggesting these indicators may play particularly important roles in the development of mental health in adolescence.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increase in applications of network science in many different fields. In clinical neuroscience and psychopathology, the developments and applications of network science have occurred mostly simultaneously, but without much collaboration between the two fields. The promise of integrating these network applications lies in a united framework to tackle one of the fundamental questions of our time: how to understand the link between brain and behavior. In the current overview, we bridge this gap by introducing conventions in both fields, highlighting similarities, and creating a common language that enables the exploitation of synergies. We provide research examples in autism research, as it accurately represents research lines in both network neuroscience and psychological networks. We integrate brain and behavior not only semantically, but also practically, by showcasing three methodological avenues that allow to combine networks of brain and behavioral data. As such, the current paper offers a stepping stone to further develop multi-modal networks and to integrate brain and behavior.},

  abstract = {Objectives Cortisol levels have been related to mood disorders at the group level, but not much is known about how cortisol relates to affective states within individuals over time. We examined the temporal dynamics of cortisol and affective states in depressed and non-depressed individuals in daily life. Specifically, we addressed the direction and timing of the effects, as well as individual differences. Methods Thirty depressed and non-depressed participants (aged 20–50 years) filled out questionnaires regarding their affect and sampled saliva three times a day for 30 days in their natural environment. They were pair-matched on age, gender, smoking behavior and body mass index. The multivariate time series (T=90) of every participant were analyzed using vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling to assess lagged effects of cortisol on affect, and vice versa. Contemporaneous effects were assessed using the residuals of the VAR models. Impulse response function analysis was used to examine the timing of effects. Results For 29 out of 30 participants, a VAR model could be constructed. A significant relationship between cortisol and positive or negative affect was found for the majority of the participants, but the direction, sign, and timing of the relationship varied among individuals. Conclusion This approach proves to be a valuable addition to traditional group designs, because our results showed that daily life fluctuations in cortisol can influence affective states, and vice versa, but not in all individuals and in varying ways. Future studies may examine whether these individual differences relate to susceptibility for or progression of mood disorders.},

Pragmatic factors include the lack of interest in mathematically precise thinking in psychology, inadequate representation of psychometric modeling in major statistics programs, and insufficient mathematical training in the psychological curriculum. Substantive factors relate to the absence of psychological theories that are sufficiently strong to motivate the structure of psychometric models. Following the identification of these problems, a number of promising recent developments are discussed, and suggestions are made to further the integration of psychology and psychometrics.},

It is argued that the proposed conception is not only simpler but also theoretically superior to the position taken in the existing literature. Further, it has clear theoretical and practical implications for validation research. Most important, validation research must not be directed at the relation between the measured attribute and other attributes but at the processes that convey the effect of the measured attribute on the test scores.

The present paper reviews psychometric modelling approaches that can be used to investigate this question through the application of statistical models. The relation between constructs and indicator variables in models with categorical and continuous latent variables is discussed, as are techniques specifically designed to address the distinction between latent categories as opposed to continua (taxometrics). In addition, we examine latent variable models that allow latent structures to have both continuous and categorical characteristics, such as factor mixture models and grade-of-membership models. Finally, we discuss recent alternative approaches based on network analysis and dynamical systems theory, which entail that the structure of constructs may be continuous for some individuals but categorical for others. Our evaluation of the psychometric literature shows that the kinds–continua distinction is considerably more subtle than is often presupposed in research; in particular, the hypotheses of kinds and continua are not mutually exclusive or exhaustive. We discuss opportunities to go beyond current research on the issue by using dynamical systems models, intra-individual time series and experimental manipulations.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

  abstract = {This article aims to improve theory formation in psychology by developing a practical methodology for constructing explanatory theories: theory construction methodology (TCM). TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies a domain of empirical phenomena that becomes the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a prototheory, a set of theoretical principles that putatively explain these phenomena. Third, the prototheory is used to construct a formal model, a set of model equations that encode explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates the explanatory adequacy of the model by formalizing its empirical phenomena and assessing whether it indeed reproduces these phenomena. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether the identified phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully and whether the explanatory principles are sufficiently parsimonious and substantively plausible. We explain TCM with an example taken from research on intelligence (the mutualism model of intelligence), in which key elements of the method have been successfully implemented. We discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

The present study aimed to construct personalized models to elucidate the emotional dynamics of subclinically depressed individuals with versus without symptoms of anhedonia. Methods Matched subclinically depressed individuals with and without symptoms of anhedonia (N = 40) of the HowNutsAreTheDutch sample completed three experience sampling methodology assessments per day for 30 days. For each individual, the impact of physical activity, stress experience, and high/low arousal PA/NA on each other was estimated through automated impulse response function analysis (IRF). These individual IRF associations were combined to compare anhedonic versus non-anhedonic individuals. Results Physical activity had low impact on affect in both groups. In non-anhedonic individuals, stress experience increased NA and decreased PA and physical activity more strongly. In anhedonic individuals, PA high arousal showed a diminished favorable impact on affect (increasing NA/stress experience, decreasing PA/physical activity). Finally, large heterogeneity in the personalized models of emotional dynamics were found. Limitations Stress experience was measured indirectly by assessing level of distress; the timeframe in between measurements was relatively long with 6h; and only information on one of the two hallmarks of anhedonia, loss of interest, was gathered. Conclusions Our results suggest different pathways of emotional dynamics underlie depressive symptomatology. Subclinically depressed individuals with anhedonic complaints are more strongly characterized by diminished favorable impact of PA high arousal and heightened NA reactivity, whereas subclinically depressed individuals without these anhedonic complaints seem more characterized by heightened stress reactivity. The automatically generated personalized models may offer patient-specific insights in emotional dynamics, which may show clinical relevance.},

Using a multiple repeated observations design, 27 depressed and 27 pair-matched nondepressed participants completed daily measurements of subjective sleep quality and duration during 30 consecutive days while an accelerometer continuously registered their physical activity. Changes in sleep duration, not quality, predicted next-day changes in physical activity (B = –0.21, p {$<$} .001), but not the other way around. Significant heterogeneity between individuals was observed, but the effect was not different for depressed and nondepressed participants. The findings underline the strength of a multiple repeated observations design in observational sleep research.},

  abstract = {The importance of replication has been recognised across many scientific disciplines. Reproducibility is a necessary condition for replicability, because an inability to reproduce results implies that the methods have not been specified sufficiently, thus precluding replication. This paper describes how two independent teams of researchers attempted to reproduce the empirical findings of an important paper, “Shrinkage estimators of time series seasonal factors and their effect on forecasting accuracy” (Miller \& Williams, 2003). The two teams proceeded systematically, reporting results both before and after receiving clarifications from the authors of the original study. The teams were able to approximately reproduce each other’s results, but not those of Miller and Williams. These discrepancies led to differences in the conclusions as to the conditions under which seasonal damping outperforms classical decomposition. The paper specifies the forecasting methods employed using a flowchart. It is argued that this approach to method documentation is complementary to the provision of computer code, as it is accessible to a broader audience of forecasting practitioners and researchers. The significance of this research lies not only in its lessons for seasonal forecasting but also, more generally, in its approach to the reproduction of forecasting research.},

  abstract = {Psychotherapie ist nachweislich wirksam. Diese Aussage trifft jedoch insbesondere auf den „Durchschnittspatienten“ in randomisiert-kontrollierten Studien zu. Da trotz der stetigen Entwicklung neuer Therapiemethoden konstant ein beträchtlicher Anteil an Patienten nicht profitiert und die Wirkmechanismen noch zu wenig verstanden werden, gilt es, innovative Psychotherapieforschung zu initiieren, die beide Probleme adressiert. Dabei sollte der aus der somatischen Medizin stammende Gedanke der Personalisierung – oder aus unserer Sicht passender – der Individualisierung bzw. Personenzentrierung aufgegriffen werden. Nach einem Überblick über Weiterentwicklungen der Psychotherapie jenseits störungsspezifischer Methoden stellen wir als visionäres Ziel psychotherapeutischer Forschung eine evidenz- und prozessbasierte individualisierte und modulare Psychotherapie vor: Jenseits der Syndrome und Störungen sollten möglichst viele biopsychosoziale Charakteristika und die den psychischen Problemen zugrunde liegenden Prozesse bzw. Mechanismen analysiert und in einer individuellen umfassenden funktionellen Analyse gebündelt werden. Auf Basis dieser Funktionsanalyse sollten evidenzbasierte Techniken und Module ausgewählt werden. Das individuelle Ansprechen im Therapieverlauf ist kontinuierlich zu dokumentieren, sodass durch Feedback das weitere therapeutische Vorgehen mitbestimmt wird. Zur Verfolgung dieser Vision werden Studien benötigt, welche an dem individuellen Patienten orientiert sind, die zentralen Wirkmechanismen untersuchen, translational große Datensätze generieren, die auch durch idiographische Analysen ausgewertet werden, sowie die Kluft zwischen Forschung und Praxis mindern und damit zu dem derzeit zu Recht ins Zentrum der Forschung rückenden Paradigma der praxisbezogenen Forschung beitragen.},

Its developmental history begins in the 1930s, with Bowlby's growing interest in the link between maternal loss or deprivation and later personality development and with Ainsworth's interest in security theory. Although Bowlby's and Ainsworth's collaboration began in 1950, it entered its most creative phase much later, after Bowlby had formulated an initial blueprint of attachment theory, drawing on ethology, control systems theory, and psychoanalytic thinking, and after Ainsworth had visited Uganda, where she conducted the 1st empirical study of infant–mother attachment patterns. This article summarizes Bowlby's and Ainsworth's separate and joint contributions to attachment theory but also touches on other theorists and researchers whose work influenced them or was influenced by them. The article then highlights some of the major new fronts along which attachment theory is currently advancing. The article ends with some speculations on the future potential of the theory.

  abstract = {In the social sciences, evaluating the effectiveness of a program or intervention often leads researchers to draw causal inferences from observational research designs. Bias in estimated causal effects becomes an obvious problem in such settings. This article presents the Heckman Model as an approach sometimes applied to observational data for the purpose of estimating an unbiased causal effect and shows how the Heckman Model can be used to correct for the problem of selection bias. It discusses in detail the assumptions necessary before the approach can be used to make causal inferences. The Heckman Model makes assumptions about the relationship between two equations in an underlying behavioral model: a response schedule and a selection function. This article shows that the Heckman Model is particularly sensitive to the choice of variables included in the selection function. This is demonstrated empirically in the context of estimating the effect of commercial coaching programs on the SAT performance of high school students. Coaching effects for both sections of the SAT are estimated using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. Small changes in the selection function are shown to have a big impact on estimated coaching effects under the Heckman Model.},

In this network approach, psychological constructs are represented as complex systems of interacting components. In addition to insightful visualization of dynamics, a network perspective leads to a new way of thinking about the nature of psychological phenomena by offering new tools for studying dynamical processes in psychology. In this article, we explain the rationale of the network approach, the associated methods and visualization, and illustrate it using an empirical example focusing on the relation between the daily fluctuations of emotions and neuroticism. The results suggest that individuals with high levels of neuroticism had a denser emotion network compared with their less neurotic peers. This effect is especially pronounced for the negative emotion network, which is in line with previous studies that found a denser network in depressed subjects than in healthy subjects. In sum, we show how the network approach may offer new tools for studying dynamical processes in psychology.},

  abstract = {In psychology, the use of intensive longitudinal data has steeply increased during the past decade. As a result, studying temporal dependencies in such data with autoregressive modeling is becoming common practice. However, standard autoregressive models are often suboptimal as they assume that parameters are time-invariant. This is problematic if changing dynamics (e.g., changes in the temporal dependency of a process) govern the time series. Often a change in the process, such as emotional well-being during therapy, is the very reason why it is interesting and important to study psychological dynamics. As a result, there is a need for an easily applicable method for studying such nonstationary processes that result from changing dynamics. In this article we present such a tool: the semiparametric TV-AR model. We show with a simulation study and an empirical application that the TV-AR model can approximate nonstationary processes well if there are at least 100 time points available and no unknown abrupt changes in the data. Notably, no prior knowledge of the processes that drive change in the dynamic structure is necessary. We conclude that the TV-AR model has significant potential for studying changing dynamics in psychology. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Emotion dynamics are likely to arise in an interpersonal context. Standard methods to study emotions in interpersonal interaction are limited because stationarity is assumed. This means that the dynamics, for example, time-lagged relations, are invariant across time periods. However, this is generally an unrealistic assumption. Whether caused by an external (e.g., divorce) or an internal (e.g., rumination) event, emotion dynamics are prone to change. The semi-parametric time-varying vector-autoregressive (TV-VAR) model is based on well-studied generalized additive models, implemented in the software R. The TV-VAR can explicitly model changes in temporal dependency without pre-existing knowledge about the nature of change. A simulation study is presented, showing that the TV-VAR model is superior to the standard time-invariant VAR model when the dynamics change over time. The TV-VAR model is applied to empirical data on daily feelings of positive affect (PA) from a single couple. Our analyses indicate reliable changes in the male’s emotion dynamics over time, but not in the female’s—which were not predicted by her own affect or that of her partner. This application illustrates the usefulness of using a TV-VAR model to detect changes in the dynamics in a system.},

This suggests that it is necessary to study how symptoms dynamically interact over time in a network architecture. In the present paper, we show how such an architecture can be constructed on the basis of time-series data obtained through Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM). The proposed methodology determines the parameters for the interaction between nodes in the network by estimating a multilevel vector autoregression (VAR) model on the data. The methodology allows combining between-subject and within-subject information in a multilevel framework. The resulting network architecture can subsequently be analyzed through network analysis techniques. In the present study, we apply the method to a set of items that assess mood-related factors. We show that the analysis generates a plausible and replicable network architecture, the structure of which is related to variables such as neuroticism; that is, for subjects who score high on neuroticism, worrying plays a more central role in the network. Implications and extensions of the methodology are discussed.},

The network approach focuses on the symptom structure or the connections between symptoms instead of the severity (i.e., mean level) of a symptom. To infer a person-specific network for a patient, time-series data are needed. By far the most common model to statistically model the person-specific interactions between symptoms or momentary states has been the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. Although the VAR model helps to bring psychological network theory into clinical research and closer to clinical practice, several discrepancies arise when we map the psychological network theory onto the VAR-based network models. These challenges and possible solutions are discussed in this review.},

However, there are many important challenges in moving from theory to empirical research and clinical practice and vice versa. Therefore, in this article, we bring together different points of view on psychological networks by methodologists and clinicians to give a critical overview on these challenges, and to present an agenda for addressing these challenges. In contrast to previous reviews, we especially focus on methodological issues related to temporal networks. This includes topics such as selecting and assessing the quality of the nodes in the network, distinguishing between- and within-person effects in networks, relating items that are measured at different time scales, and dealing with changes in network structures. These issues are not only important for researchers using network models on empirical data, but also for clinicians, who are increasingly likely to encounter (person-specific) networks in the consulting room.},

Such predictions do not enable the high-risk tests that would strengthen our belief in the verisimilitude of theories but instead lead to the practice of null-hypothesis significance testing, a practice Meehl believed to be a major reason for the slow theoretical progress of soft psychology. The rising popularity of meta-analysis has led some to argue that we should move away from significance testing and focus on the size and stability of effects instead. Proponents of this reform assume that a greater emphasis on quantity can help psychology to develop a cumulative body of knowledge. The crucial question in this endeavor is whether the resulting numbers really have theoretical meaning. Psychological science lacks an undisputed, preexisting domain of observations analogous to the observations in the space-time continuum in physics. It is argued that, for this reason, effect sizes do not really exist independently of the adopted research design that led to their manifestation. Consequently, they can have no bearing on the verisimilitude of a theory.},

  abstract = {The number of intensive longitudinal studies that investigate affective experiences at the withinperson rather than the between-person level is rapidly increasing. This paradigmatic shift comes with new challenges such as questions revolving around how to measure within-person affect variation or more fundamental questions about the reliability and validity of constructs at the within-person level. We provide a review of substantive research published in Emotion since 2005, which revealed that to date no consensus has been established on measurement instruments for assessing within-person affective experiences. Our review also showed that researchers who are interested in within-person affect variation sometimes rely on measurement instruments that were established at the between-person level, which we think should be reconsidered. Finally, reliability estimates of state variation have been developed, but are not comprehensively reported in studies on within-person affect variation. The purpose of this paper is therefore to alert the reader to these issues and to highlight relevant criteria for selecting items and measurement instruments when studying within-person affect variation in intensive longitudinal studies. We recommend establishing common standards for measuring within-person affect variation, and to draw from a common pool of instruments because this would allow direct comparison of results across studies.},

Methods A longitudinal multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 8–14-year-old children with active epilepsy. Participants wore a pedometer to track daily PA and completed 3 measures at 4 time points to examine depressive symptoms and QoL. Stratified by site and activity level, participants were randomized to an intervention or control group. The 6-month intervention included 11 behavioral counseling sessions targeting self-regulation of PA. To assess the associations among PA, depression scores, and QoL, primary analysis involved mixed-effects models. Results We recruited 122 CWE, of whom 115 were randomized (Mage\,=\,11\,±\,2; 50\% female) and included in the analysis. The intervention did not increase PA in the treatment compared with the control group. No differences were found between groups over time during the subsequent 6\,months, where PA decreased among all participants. Results did not show differences between the groups and over time for measures of depressive symptoms and QoL. Significance The intervention did not improve or sustain PA levels over 12\,months. Both groups demonstrated declines in PA over one year, but there were no changes in depression scores or QoL. As most participants were already nearly reaching the Canadian average of step counts of children their age, with a baseline daily step count of over 9000, there may be a challenge for further increasing PA over a longer period.},

The current study used the experience-sampling methodology to examine associations between depressive symptoms, social contact, and daily life impairment in 197 young adults. Depressive symptoms were associated with increased isolation, negative affect, anhedonia, and physical symptoms, decreased positive affect, and social and cognitive impairment in daily life. For people with more depressive symptoms, being with social partners who were perceived as close was associated with greater decreases in negative affect, as well as increases in positive affect. Ironically, participants with depressive symptoms reported spending less time with people whom they perceived as close, minimizing the protective effects of socializing. These results suggest that people experiencing depressive symptoms may be especially sensitive to the nature of social interactions.},

Unfortunately— because human behavior is, after all, complex and difficult to understand—we have no way of knowing whether the fact that it took so long for these deficiencies to be recognized was due to an unwarranted degree of optimism about the reliability of the peer-review process, a reluctance to make waves in the face of powerful interests, a general lack of critical thinking within positive psychology, or some other factor. We hope that our revelation of the problems with the critical positivity ratio ultimately demonstrates the success of science as a self-correcting endeavor; however, we would have greatly preferred it if our work had not been necessary in the first place.

It has found expression not only in academic papers but also popular books and, increasingly, in government policy. The Routledge International Handbook of Critical Positive Psychology is the first volume dedicated to a critical appraisal of this influential but controversial field of study. The book critically examines not only the scientific foundations of positive psychology, but also the sociocultural and political tenets on which the field rests. It evaluates the current field of knowledge and practice, and includes chapters analysing the methodological constructs of the field, as well as others that question what positive psychology actually means by ideas such as happiness or well-being. Taking the debate further, the book then discusses how positive psychology can be applied in a wider variety of settings than is presently the case, helping communities and individuals by acknowledging the reality of people?s lives rather than adhering strictly to debateable theoretical constructs. Including contributions from disciplines ranging from psychoanalysis to existential therapy, theology to philosophy, and contributors from throughout the world, The Routledge International Handbook of Critical Positive Psychology will be enlightening reading for anyone interested in how psychology has sought to understand human well-being.},

  abstract = {This case study describes 1 year of the psychoanalytic psychotherapy using clinical data, a standardized instrument of the psychotherapeutic process (Psychotherapy process Q-Set, PQS), and functional neuroimaging (fMRI). A female dysthymic patient with narcissistic traits was assessed at monthly intervals (12 sessions). In the fMRI scans, which took place immediately after therapy hours, the patient looked at pictures of attachment-relevant scenes (from the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System, AAP) divided into two groups: those accompanied by a neutral description, and those accompanied by a description tailored to core conflicts of the patient as assessed in the AAP. Clinically, this patient presented defense mechanisms that influenced the relationship with the therapist and that was characterized by fluctuations of mood that lasted whole days, following a pattern that remained stable during the year of the study. The two modes of functioning associated with the mood shifts strongly affected the interaction with the therapist, whose quality varied accordingly (“easy” and “difficult” hours). The PQS analysis showed the association of “easy” hours with the topic of the involvement in significant relationships and of “difficult hours” with self-distancing, a defensive maneuver common in narcissistic personality structures. In the fMRI data, the modes of functioning visible in the therapy hours were significantly associated with modulation of the signal elicited by personalized attachment-related scenes in the posterior cingulate (p = 0.017 cluster-level, whole-volume corrected). This region has been associated in previous studies to self-distancing from negatively valenced pictures presented during the scan.

This is a step in the right direction because mediation analyses based on nonexperimental data are likely to be biased and because experiments, in principle, provide a sound basis for causal inference. But even experiments cannot overcome certain threats to inference that arise chiefly or exclusively in the context of mediation analysis—threats that have received little attention in psychology. The authors describe 3 of these threats and suggest ways to improve the exposition and design of mediation tests. Their conclusion is that inference about mediators is far more difficult than previous research suggests and is best tackled by an experimental research program that is specifically designed to address the challenges of mediation analysis.},

  abstract = {Many questions in the behavioral sciences focus on the causal interplay of a number of variables across time. To reveal the dynamic relations between the variables, their (auto- or cross-) regressive effects across time may be inspected by fitting a lag-one vector autoregressive, or VAR(1), model and visualizing the resulting regression coefficients as the edges of a weighted directed network. Usually, the raw VAR(1) regression coefficients are drawn, but we argue that this may yield misleading network figures and characteristics because of two problems. First, the raw regression coefficients are sensitive to scale and variance differences among the variables and therefore may lack comparability, which is needed if one wants to calculate, for example, centrality measures. Second, they only represent the unique direct effects of the variables, which may give a distorted picture when variables correlate strongly. To deal with these problems, we propose to use other VAR(1)-based measures as edges. Specifically, to solve the comparability issue, the standardized VAR(1) regression coefficients can be displayed. Furthermore, relative importance metrics can be computed to include direct as well as shared and indirect effects into the network.},

Although several models have been proposed for the data obtained from such measurements, none have succeeded in incorporating the response time information. Given that currently, many psychological measurements are performed via computers, it would be beneficial to develop a joint model involving an MAFC item response and response time. The present study proposes the first model that combines a cognitive process model that underlies the observed response time and the forced-choice item response model. Specifically, the proposed model is based on the linear ballistic accumulator model of response time, which is substantially extended by reformulating its parameters so as to incorporate the MAFC item responses. The model parameters are estimated by the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. A simulation study confirmed that the proposed approach could appropriately recover the parameters. Two empirical applications are reported to demonstrate the use of the proposed model and compare it with existing models. The results showed that the proposed model could be a useful tool for jointly modeling the MAFC item responses and response times.},

We argue that the gap between statistical tools and clinical practice can partly be explained by the fact that current estimation techniques disregard theoretical and practical considerations relevant to psychotherapy. To address this issue, we propose that case conceptualizations should be formalized. We illustrate this approach by introducing a computational model of functional analysis, a framework commonly used by practitioners to formulate case conceptualizations and design patient-tailored treatment.},

  abstract = {Statistical innovations allow clinicians to estimate personalized networks from longitudinal data, for example data collected via the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). Such networks can generate insights that may be relevant for constructing case formulations, and therefore guide the selection of personalized treatment targets. While the notion of personalized networks aligns well with the way clinicians think and reason, there are currently several barriers to clinical implementation that limit the utility of such models. First, the most popular network estimation routines are data-driven and do not allow clinicians to incorporate their expertise and theory. Second, network models have many parameters, which can make accurate estimation challenging. Finally, network estimation requires technical skills that are not regularly taught in clinical programs. In this article, we introduce PREMISE, an approach that formally integrates case formulations with personalized network estimation. Using prior elicitation techniques, clinical working hypotheses are translated into formal models, which can subsequently inform network estimation from ESM data using Bayesian inference. PREMISE tackles the three challenges described above: Incorporating clinical information into network estimation systematically allows theoretical and data-driven integration, which in turn increases the accuracy of network estimation techniques. In addition, we implemented the principles of PREMISE into a practical web-based toolkit that generates intuitive feedback, thereby facilitating clinical implementation. To illustrate its clinical potential, we use PREMISE to estimate clinically informed networks for a client suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. We discuss open challenges in selecting statistical models for PREMISE, as well as specific future directions for clinical implementation.},

  abstract = {Introduction The network approach to psychopathology aims to solve problems with heterogeneity and comorbidity, as well as advance psychiatric precision medicine. Statistical relations in networks can be estimated from intensive longitudinal data, but causal interpretations of such networks are limited by strong statistical assumptions and the frequency of assessments heavily influences which relations can be discovered. Objective An alternative is to create networks from patient perceptions, which comes with other limitations such as retrospective bias. As a synthesis, we introduce the Longitudinal Perceived Causal Relations (L-PCR) approach. Methods 20 participants screening positive for depression completed up to 28 days of brief assessments of experienced symptoms and perceived symptom-symptom influences. Quality criteria of this new method are introduced via a bootstrapping algorithm, answering questions such as “Which symptoms should be included in networks?”, “How many datapoints need to be collected to achieve stable networks?”, and “Does the network change over time?”. Results To achieve stability, networks had to be created using only a core of frequently experienced symptoms, i.e. symptoms experienced during at least a third of days. About 40\% of respondents achieved stable networks and only a few respondents exhibited changes in network structure across time. The method was time efficient (on average 7.4 minutes per day) and well received by participants. Conclusions Future directions of L-PCR include individualized core symptoms in a controlled clinical population, as well as additional assessment types such as counterfactual questions. Overall, L-PCR addresses several of the prevailing issues found in statistical networks and therefore provides a clinically-meaningful method for personalized analysis.},

In the absence of any actual new data to predict, cross-validation can be used to estimate a model’s future predictive accuracy, for instance, for the purpose of model comparison or selection. Exact crossvalidation for Bayesian models is often computationally expensive, but approximate cross-validation methods have been developed, most notably methods for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). If the actual prediction task is to predict the future given the past, LOO-CV provides an overly optimistic estimate because the information from future observations is available to influence predictions of the past. To properly account for the time series structure, we can use leave-future-out cross-validation (LFO-CV). Like exact LOO-CV, exact LFO-CV requires refitting the model many times to different subsets of the data. Using Pareto smoothed importance sampling, we propose a method for approximating exact LFO-CV that drastically reduces the computational costs while also providing informative diagnostics about the quality of the approximation.},

Modern devices for activity monitoring (actigraphs) make it possible to monitor physical activity unobtrusively but the validity of actigraphy as an indicator of mood state is uncertain. We carried out a systematic review of digital actigraphy in patients with depression to investigate the associations between measured physical activity and depression. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies were identified from Medline, EMBASE and Psycinfo databases and included if they were either case control or longitudinal studies of actigraphy in adults aged between 18 and 65 diagnosed with a depressive disorder. Outcomes were daytime and night-time activity and actigraphic measures of sleep. Results We identified 19 eligible papers from 16 studies (412 patients). Case control studies showed less daytime activity in patients with depression (standardised mean difference −0.76, 95\% confidence intervals −1.05 to −0.47). Longitudinal studies showed moderate increase in daytime activity (0.53, 0.20 to 0.87) and a reduction in night-time activity (−0.36, −0.65 to −0.06) over the course of treatment. Limitations All study participants were unblinded. Only seven papers included patients treated in the community. Conclusions Actigraphy is a potentially valuable source of additional information about patients with depression. However, there are no clear guidelines for use of actigraphy in studies of patients with depression. Further studies should investigate patients treated in the community. Additional work to develop algorithms for differentiating behaviour patterns is also needed.},

Such evaluation cannot be achieved with studies of real data alone. Designing high-quality simulations that reflect the complex situations seen in practice, such as in prognostic factors studies, is not a simple process. Unfortunately, very few published simulation studies provide sufficient details to allow readers to understand fully all the processes required to design a simulation study. When planning a simulation study, it is recommended that a detailed protocol be produced, giving full details of how the study will be performed, analysed and reported. This paper details the important considerations necessary when designing any simulation study, including defining specific objectives of the study, determining the procedures for generating the data sets and the number of simulations to perform. A checklist highlighting the important considerations when designing a simulation study is provided.

  abstract = {Background: Bipolar disorder is a prevalent mental health condition that is imposing significant burden on society. Accurate forecasting of symptom scores can be used to improve disease monitoring, enable early intervention, and eventually help prevent costly hospitalizations. Although several studies have examined the use of smartphone data to detect mood, only few studies deal with forecasting mood for one or more days. Objective: This study aimed to examine the feasibility of forecasting daily subjective mood scores based on daily self-assessments collected from patients with bipolar disorder via a smartphone-based system in a randomized clinical trial. Methods: We applied hierarchical Bayesian regression models, a multi-task learning method, to account for individual differences and forecast mood for up to seven days based on 15,975 smartphone self-assessments from 84 patients with bipolar disorder participating in a randomized clinical trial. We reported the results of two time-series cross-validation 1-day forecast experiments corresponding to two different real-world scenarios and compared the outcomes with commonly used baseline methods. We then applied the best model to evaluate a 7-day forecast. Results: The best performing model used a history of 4 days of self-assessment to predict future mood scores with historical mood being the most important predictor variable. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian regression model outperformed pooled and separate models in a 1-day forecast time-series cross-validation experiment and achieved the predicted metrics, R2=0.51 and root mean squared error of 0.32, for mood scores on a scale of −3 to 3. When increasing the forecast horizon, forecast errors also increased and the forecast regressed toward the mean of data distribution. Conclusions: Our proposed method can forecast mood for several days with low error compared with common baseline methods. The applicability of a mood forecast in the clinical treatment of bipolar disorder has also been discussed.},

  abstract = {Background Adolescence is characterized by substantial changes in sleep behavior, heightened exposure to stressful life events (SLEs), and elevated risk for internalizing problems like anxiety and depression. Although SLEs are consistently associated with the onset of internalizing psychopathology, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain poorly understood, especially at the within-person level. Here, we leverage a high-frequency longitudinal design to examine sleep as a potential mechanism linking SLEs to increases in anxiety and depression symptoms over a one-year period. Methods Thirty female adolescents aged 15–17 years completed 12 monthly in-laboratory assessments of exposure to SLEs and symptoms of anxiety and depression (n = 355 monthly assessments), and wore an actigraphy wristband for continuous monitoring of sleep for the duration of the study (n = 6,824 sleep days). Multilevel models examined concurrent and lagged within-person associations between SLEs, sleep duration and timing regularity, and anxiety and depression symptoms. Results Within-person fluctuations in SLEs were associated with variability in sleep duration both concurrently and prospectively, such that when adolescents experienced greater SLEs than was typical for them, they exhibited more variable sleep duration that same month as well as the following month. In turn, within-person increases in sleep duration variability predicted greater anxiety symptoms in the same month and mediated the association between SLEs and anxiety. Conclusions These findings highlight sleep disruptions as a mechanism underlying the longitudinal associations between SLEs and anxiety symptoms, and suggest that interventions promoting sleep schedule consistency may help mitigate risk for stress-related psychopathology in adolescence.},

  abstract = {This article introduces an innovative mentalization-based treatment (MBT) parenting intervention for families where children are at risk of maltreatment. The Lighthouse MBT Parenting Programme aims to prevent child maltreatment by promoting sensitive caregiving in parents. The programme is designed to enhance parents’ capacity for curiosity about their child’s inner world, to help parents ‘see’ (understand) their children clearly, to make sense of misunderstandings in their relationship with their child and to help parents inhibit harmful responses in those moments of misunderstanding and to repair the relationship when harmed. The programme is an adaptation of MBT for borderline and antisocial personality disorders, with a particular focus on attachment and child development. Its strength is in engaging hard to reach parents, who typically do not benefit from parenting programmes. The findings of the pilot evaluation suggest that the programme may be effective in improving parenting confidence and sensitivity and that parents valued the programme and the changes it had helped them to bring about.},

  abstract = {Detecting abrupt correlation changes in multivariate time series is crucial in many application fields such as signal processing, functional neuroimaging, climate studies, and financial analysis. To detect such changes, several promising correlation change tests exist, but they may suffer from severe loss of power when there is actually more than one change point underlying the data. To deal with this drawback, we propose a permutation based significance test for Kernel Change Point (KCP) detection on the running correlations. Given a requested number of change points K, KCP divides the time series into K\,+\,1 phases by minimizing the within-phase variance. The new permutation test looks at how the average within-phase variance decreases when K increases and compares this to the results for permuted data. The results of an extensive simulation study and applications to several real data sets show that, depending on the setting, the new test performs either at par or better than the state-of-the art significance tests for detecting the presence of correlation changes, implying that its use can be generally recommended.},

Loneliness was again associated with more depressive symptoms, net of demographic covariates, marital status, social support, hostility, and perceived stress.

The pressing question now is whether recently discovered variants describe the etiology of a single disease entity. There are a myriad of ways to measure and operationalize depression severity, and major depressive disorder as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 can manifest in more than 10 000 ways based on symptom profiles alone. Variations in developmental timing, comorbidity and environmental contexts across individuals and samples further add to the heterogeneity. With big data increasingly enabling genomic discovery in psychiatry, it is more timely than ever to explicitly disentangle genetic contributions to what is likely ‘depressions’ rather than depression. Here, we introduce three sources of heterogeneity: operationalization, manifestation and etiology. We review recent efforts to identify depression subtypes using clinical and data-driven approaches, examine differences in genetic architecture of depression across contexts, and argue that heterogeneity in operationalizations of depression is likely a considerable source of inconsistency. Finally, we offer recommendations and considerations for the field going forward.},

Methods A total of 163 teachers (66.3\% women; aged 45~±~9 years) filled out a sleep diary and wore a wrist actigraph device for seven consecutive days. Data were collected from August 2014 to March 2015 in Londrina, a large city in southern Brazil. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were used to compare self-reported and actigraphic data. Results Self-reported total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), and sleep efficiency were higher than measured by actigraphy (mean difference: 22.6~±~46.9~min, 2.6~±~13.3~min, and 7.3±~5.7\%, respectively). Subjective total time in bed (TIB) and wake-up time were lower than measured by actigraphy (mean difference:~−10.7~±~37.6 and~−19.7~±~29.6, respectively). Moderate or good agreement and correlation were found between the sleep diary and the actigraphic data for TST (ICC~=~0.70; r~=~0.60), TIB (ICC~=~0.83; r~=~0.73), bedtime (ICC~=~0.95; r~=~0.91), sleep start time (ICC~=~0.94; r~=~0.88), and wake-up time (ICC~=~0.87; r~=~0.78). However, SOL (ICC~=~0.49; r~=~0.38) and sleep efficiency (ICC~=~0.16; r~=~0.22) showed only fair or poor agreement and correlation. Conclusion In this highly educated population, the sleep diary and the actigraphy showed moderate or good agreement to assess several sleep parameters. However, these methods seemed to measure different dimensions of sleep regarding sleep onset latency and efficiency. These findings moderately varied according to the individual's subjective sleep quality.},

  abstract = {Multiverse analysis involves systematically sampling a vast set of model specifications, known as a multiverse, to estimate the uncertainty surrounding the validity of a scientific claim. By fitting these specifications to a sample of observations, statistics are obtained as analytical results. Examining the variability of these statistics across different groups of model specifications helps to assess the robustness of the claim and gives insights into its underlying assumptions. However, the theoretical premises of multiverse analysis are often implicit and not universally agreed upon. To address this, a new formal categorisation of the analytical choices involved in modelling the set of specifications is proposed. This method of indexing the specification highlights that the sampling structure of the multiversal sample does not conform to a model of independent and identically distributed draws of specifications and that it can be modelled as an information network instead. Hamming’s distance is proposed as a measure of network distance, and, with an application to a panel dataset, it is shown how this approach enhances transparency in procedures and inferred claims and that it facilitates the check of implicit parametric assumptions. In the conclusions, the proposed theory of multiversal sampling is linked to the ongoing debate on how to weigh a multiverse, including the debate on the epistemic value of crowdsourced multiverses.},

Out of the 2078 articles screened, a total of 20 studies met all inclusion criteria. Results showed a pooled effect size at post-treatment of Hedges g = .05 (95\% CI, −.09 to .20), indicating that ICBT and face-to-face treatment produced equivalent overall effects. Study quality did not affect outcomes. While the overall results indicate equivalence, there have been few studies of the individual psychiatric and somatic conditions so far, and for the majority, guided ICBT has not been compared against face-to-face treatment. Thus, more research, preferably with larger sample sizes, is needed to establish the general equivalence of the two treatment formats.},

Data were collected from 52 participants, with a mean of 37 weeks of acceleration data with a corresponding depression score recorded per participant. Time varying hidden Markov models were used to extract weekly features of activity, sleep and circadian rhythms. Personalised regression achieved mean absolute errors of 1.00(0.57) from a possible scale of 0 to 27 and was able to classify depression with an accuracy of 0.84(0.16). The results demonstrate features derived from smartphone accelerometers are able to provide objective markers of depression. Low barriers for uptake exist due to the widespread use of smartphones, with personalised models able to account for differences in the behaviour of individuals and provide accurate predictions of depression.},

  abstract = {The accessibility to electronic devices and the novel statistical methodologies available have allowed researchers to comprehend psychological processes at the individual level. However, there are still great challenges to overcome as, in many cases, collected data are more complex than the available models are able to handle. For example, most methods assume that the variables in the time series are measured on an interval scale, which is not the case when Likert-scale items were used. Ignoring the scale of the variables can be problematic and bias the results. Additionally, most methods also assume that the time series are stationary, which is rarely the case. To tackle these disadvantages, we propose a model that combines the partial credit model (PCM) of the item response theory framework and the time-varying autoregressive model (TV-AR), which is a popular model used to study psychological dynamics. The proposed model is referred to as the time-varying dynamic partial credit model (TV-DPCM), which allows to appropriately analyze multivariate polytomous data and nonstationary time series. We test the performance and accuracy of the TV-DPCM in a simulation study. Lastly, by means of an example, we show how to fit the model to empirical data and interpret the results.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, researchers have used time series and multilevel models to analyze intensive longitudinal data. However, these models do not directly address traits and states which conceptualize the stability and variability implicit in longitudinal research, and they do not explicitly take into account measurement error. An alternative to overcome these drawbacks is to consider structural equation models (state-trait SEMs) for longitudinal data that represent traits and states as latent variables. Most of these models are encompassed in the latent state-trait (LST) theory. These state-trait SEMs can be problematic when the number of measurement occasions increases. As they require the data to be in wide format, these models quickly become overparameterized and lead to nonconvergence issues. For these reasons, multilevel versions of state-trait SEMs have been proposed, which require the data in long format. To study how suitable state-trait SEMs are for intensive longitudinal data, we carried out a simulation study. We compared the traditional single level to the multilevel version of three state-trait SEMs. The selected models were the multistate-singletrait (MSST) model, the common and unique trait-state (CUTS) model, and the trait–state-occasion (TSO) model. Furthermore, we also included an empirical application. Our results indicated that the TSO model performed best in both the simulated and the empirical data. To conclude, we highlight the usefulness of state-trait SEMs to study the psychometric properties of the questionnaires used in intensive longitudinal data. Yet, these models still have multiple limitations, some of which might be overcome by extending them to more general frameworks. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

In Inventing Temperature, Chang examines how scientists first created thermometers; how they measured temperature beyond the reach of standard thermometers; and how they managed to assess the reliability and accuracy of these instruments without a circular reliance on the instruments themselves. In a discussion that brings together the history of science with the philosophy of science, Chang presents the simple eet challenging epistemic and technical questions about these instruments, and the complex web of abstract philosophical issues surrounding them. Chang's book shows that many items of knowledge that we take for granted now are in fact spectacular achievements, obtained only after a great deal of innovative thinking, painstaking experiments, bold conjectures, and controversy. Lurking behind these achievements are some very important philosophical questions about how and when people accept the authority of science.},

  abstract = {This paper takes a broad, pragmatic view of statistical inference to include all aspects of model formulation. The estimation of model parameters traditionally assumes that a model has a prespecified known form and takes no account of possible uncertainty regarding the model structure. This implicitly assumes the existence of a `true' model, which many would regard as a fiction. In practice model uncertainty is a fact of life and likely to be more serious than other sources of uncertainty which have received far more attention from statisticians. This is true whether the model is specified on subject-matter grounds or, as is increasingly the case, when a model is formulated, fitted and checked on the same data set in an iterative, interactive way. Modern computing power allows a large number of models to be considered and data-dependent specification searches have become the norm in many areas of statistics. The term data mining may be used in this context when the analyst goes to great lengths to obtain a good fit. This paper reviews the effects of model uncertainty, such as too narrow prediction intervals, and the non-trivial biases in parameter estimates which can follow data-based modelling. Ways of assessing and overcoming the effects of model uncertainty are discussed, including the use of simulation and resampling methods, a Bayesian model averaging approach and collecting additional data wherever possible. Perhaps the main aim of the paper is to ensure that statisticians are aware of the problems and start addressing the issues even if there is no simple, general theoretical fix.},

  abstract = {In time-series analysis, a model is rarely pre-specified but rather is typically formulated in an iterative, interactive way using the given time-series data. Unfortunately the properties of the fitted model, and the forecasts from it, are generally calculated as if the model were known in the first place. This is theoretically incorrect, as least squares theory, for example, does not apply when the same data are used to formulates and fit a model. Ignoring prior model selection leads to biases, not only in estimates of model parameters but also in the subsequent construction of prediction intervals. The latter are typically too narrow, partly because they do not allow for model uncertainty. Empirical results also suggest that more complicated models tend to give a better fit but poorer ex-ante forecasts. The reasons behind these phenomena are reviewed. When comparing different forecasting models, the BIC is preferred to the AIC for identifying a model on the basis of within-sample fit, but out-of-sample forecasting accuracy provides the real test. Alternative approaches to forecasting, which avoid conditioning on a single model, include Bayesian model averaging and using a forecasting method which is not model-based but which is designed to be adaptable and robust.},

Because of the cost and scarcity of medical outcomes data, this hope is typically based on investigators observing a model’s success in one or two datasets or clinical contexts. We scrutinized this optimism by examining how well a machine learning model performed across several independent clinical trials of antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia. Models predicted patient outcomes with high accuracy within the trial in which the model was developed but performed no better than chance when applied out-of-sample. Pooling data across trials to predict outcomes in the trial left out did not improve predictions.

  abstract = {Head movement is an important but often overlooked component of emotion and social interaction. Examination of regularity and differences in head movements of infant-mother dyads over time and across dyads can shed light on whether and how mothers and infants alter their dynamics over the course of an interaction to adapt to each others. One way to study these emergent differences in dynamics is to allow parameters that govern the patterns of interactions to change over time, and according to person- and dyad-specific characteristics. Using two estimation approaches to implement variations of a vector-autoregressive model with time-varying coefficients, we investigated the dynamics of automatically-tracked head movements in mothers and infants during the Face-Face/Still-Face Procedure (SFP) with 24 infant-mother dyads. The first approach requires specification of a confirmatory model for the time-varying parameters as part of a state-space model, whereas the second approach handles the time-varying parameters in a semi-parametric (“mostly” model-free) fashion within a generalized additive modeling framework. Results suggested that infant-mother head movement dynamics varied in time both within and across episodes of the SFP, and varied based on infants’ subsequently-assessed attachment security. Code for implementing the time-varying vector-autoregressive model using two R packages, dynr and mgcv, is provided.},

  abstract = {Objectives The understanding of how stress influences health behavior can provide insights into developing healthy lifestyle interventions. This understanding is traditionally attained through observational studies that examine associations at a population level. This nomothetic approach, however, is fundamentally limited by the fact that the environment-person milieu that constitutes stress exposure and experience can vary substantially between individuals, and the modifiable elements of these exposures and experiences are individual-specific. With recent advances in smartphone and sensing technologies, it is now possible to conduct idiographic assessment in users’ own environment, leveraging the full-range observations of actions and experiences that result in differential response to naturally occurring events. The aim of this paper is to explore the hypothesis that an ideographic N-of-1 model can better capture an individual’s stress-behavior pathway (or the lack thereof) and provide useful person-specific predictors of exercise behavior. Methods This paper used the data collected in an observational study in 79 participants who were followed for up to a 1-year period, wherein their physical activity was continuously and objectively monitored by actigraphy and their stress experience was recorded via ecological momentary assessment on a mobile app. In addition, our analyses considered exogenous and environmental variables retrieved from public archive such as day in a week, daylight time, temperature and precipitation. Leveraging the multiple data sources, we developed prediction algorithms for exercise behavior using random forest and classification tree techniques using a nomothetic approach and an N-of-1 approach. The two approaches were compared based on classification errors in predicting personalized exercise behavior. Results Eight factors were selected by random forest for the nomothetic decision model, which was used to predict whether a participant would exercise on a particular day. The predictors included previous exercise behavior, emotional factors (e.g., midday stress), external factors such as weather (e.g., temperature), and self-determination factors (e.g., expectation of exercise). The nomothetic model yielded an average classification error of 36\%. The ideographic N-of-1 models used on average about two predictors for each individual, and had an average classification error of 25\%, which represented an improvement of 11 percentage points. Conclusions Compared to the traditional one-size-fits-all, nomothetic model that generalizes population-evidence for individuals, the proposed N-of-1 model can better capture the individual difference in their stress-behavior pathways. In this paper, we demonstrate it is feasible to perform personalized exercise behavior prediction, mainly made possible by mobile health technology and machine learning analytics.},

Prior research has mainly investigated physical activity on an aggregate level over short period of time, e.g., during 3 to 7 days at baseline and few-month later, post intervention. To develop effective interventions, we need a better understanding of the temporal dynamics of physical activity. We proposed here an approach to studying walking behavior at “high-resolution” and by capturing the idiographic and day-to-day changes in that behavior. We analyzed daily step count among 151 young adults with overweight or obesity who had worn an accelerometer for an average of 226 days (\textasciitilde 25,000 observations). We then used a recursive partitioning algorithm to characterize patterns of change, here sudden behavioral gains and losses, over the course of the study. These behavioral gains or losses were defined as a 30\% increase or reduction in steps relative to each participants’ median level of steps lasting at least 7 days. After the identification of gains and losses, fluctuation intensity in steps from each participant’s individual time series was computed with a dynamic complexity algorithm to identify potential early warning signals of sudden gains or losses. Results revealed that walking behavior change exhibits non-linearities that can be described as sudden gains and losses. On average, participants experienced six sudden gains or losses over the study. We also observed a significant and positive association between critical fluctuations in walking behavior, a form of early warning signals, and the subsequent occurrence of sudden behavioral losses in the next days. Altogether, this study suggests that walking behavior could be well understood under a dynamic paradigm. Results also provide support for the development of “just-in-time” behavioral interventions based on the detection of early warning signals for sudden behavioral losses.},

We analyzed daily step count among 151 young adults with overweight or obesity who had worn an accelerometer for an average of 226 days (\textbackslash textasciitilde 25,000 observations). We then used a recursive partitioning algorithm to characterize patterns of change, here sudden behavioral gains and losses, over the course of the study. These behavioral gains or losses were defined as a 30\% increase or reduction in steps relative to each participants’ median level of steps lasting at least 7 days. After the identification of gains and losses, fluctuation intensity in steps from each participant’s individual time series was computed with a dynamic complexity algorithm to identify potential early warning signals of sudden gains or losses. Results revealed that walking behavior change exhibits non-linearities that can be described as sudden gains and losses. On average, participants experienced six sudden gains or losses over the study. We also observed a significant and positive association between critical fluctuations in walking behavior, a form of early warning signals, and the subsequent occurrence of sudden behavioral losses in the next days. Altogether, this study suggests that walking behavior could be well understood under a dynamic paradigm. Results also provide support for the development of “just-in-time” behavioral interventions based on the detection of early warning signals for sudden behavioral losses.},

However, the causality and direction of this association are not clear; physical activity may protect against depression, and/or depression may result in decreased physical activity.To examine bidirectional relationships between physical activity and depression using a genetically informed method for assessing potential causal inference.This 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) used  independent top genetic variants associated with 2 physical activity phenotypes—self-reported (n\,=\,377\,234) and objective accelerometer-based (n\,=\,91\,084)—and with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n\,=\,143\,265) as genetic instruments from the largest available, nonoverlapping genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS were previously conducted in diverse observational cohorts, including the UK Biobank (for physical activity) and participating studies in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (for MDD) among adults of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization estimates from each genetic instrument were combined using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis, with alternate methods (eg, weighted median, MR Egger, MR–Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier [PRESSO]) and multiple sensitivity analyses to assess horizontal pleiotropy and remove outliers. Data were analyzed from May 10 through July 31, 2018.MDD and physical activity.GWAS summary data were available for a combined sample size of 611\,583 adult participants. Mendelian randomization evidence suggested a protective relationship between accelerometer-based activity and MDD (odds ratio [OR],\,0.74 for MDD per 1-SD increase in mean acceleration; 95\% CI, 0.59-0.92; P\,=\,.006). In contrast, there was no statistically significant relationship between MDD and accelerometer-based activity (β\,=\,−0.08 in mean acceleration per MDD vs control status; 95\% CI, −0.47 to 0.32; P\,=\,.70). Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between self-reported activity and MDD (OR, 1.28 for MDD per 1-SD increase in metabolic-equivalent minutes of reported moderate-to-vigorous activity; 95\% CI, 0.57-3.37; P\,=\,.48), or between MDD and self-reported activity (β\,=\,0.02 per MDD in standardized metabolic-equivalent minutes of reported moderate-to-vigorous activity per MDD vs control status; 95\% CI, −0.008 to 0.05; P\,=\,.15).Using genetic instruments identified from large-scale GWAS, robust evidence supports a protective relationship between objectively assessed—but not self-reported—physical activity and the risk for MDD. Findings point to the importance of objective measurement of physical activity in epidemiologic studies of mental health and support the hypothesis that enhancing physical activity may be an effective prevention strategy for depression.}

  abstract = {Background: Virtually, all organisms on Earth have their own circadian rhythm, and humans are no exception. Circadian rhythms are associated with various human states, especially mood disorders, and disturbance of the circadian rhythm is known to be very closely related. Attempts have also been made to derive clinical implications associated with mood disorders using the vast amounts of digital log that is acquired by digital technologies develop and using computational analysis techniques. Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the mood state or episode, activity, sleep, light exposure, and heart rate during a period of about 2 years by acquiring various digital log data through wearable devices and smartphone apps as well as conventional clinical assessments. We investigated a mood prediction algorithm developed with machine learning using passive data phenotypes based on circadian rhythms. Methods: We performed a prospective observational cohort study on 55 patients with mood disorders (major depressive disorder [MDD] and bipolar disorder type 1 [BD I] and 2 [BD II]) for 2 years. A smartphone app for self-recording daily mood scores and detecting light exposure (using the installed sensor) were provided. From daily worn activity trackers, digital log data of activity, sleep, and heart rate were collected. Passive digital phenotypes were processed into 130 features based on circadian rhythms, and a mood prediction algorithm was developed by random forest. Results: The mood state prediction accuracies for the next 3 days in all patients, MDD patients, BD I patients, and BD II patients were 65\%, 65\%, 64\%, and 65\% with 0.7, 0.69, 0.67, and 0.67 area under the curve (AUC) values, respectively. The accuracies of all patients for no episode (NE), depressive episode (DE), manic episode (ME), and hypomanic episode (HME) were 85.3\%, 87\%, 94\%, and 91.2\% with 0.87, 0.87, 0.958, and 0.912 AUC values, respectively. The prediction accuracy in BD II patients was distinctively balanced as high showing 82.6\%, 74.4\%, and 87.5\% of accuracy (with generally good sensitivity and specificity) with 0.919, 0.868, and 0.949 AUC values for NE, DE, and HME, respectively. Conclusions: On the basis of the theoretical basis of chronobiology, this study proposed a good model for future research by developing a mood prediction algorithm using machine learning by processing and reclassifying digital log data. In addition to academic value, it is expected that this study will be of practical help to improve the prognosis of patients with mood disorders by making it possible to apply actual clinical application owing to the rapid expansion of digital technology.},

  abstract = {Eye-tracking has emerged as a popular method for empirical studies of cognitive processes across multiple substantive research areas. Eye-tracking systems are capable of automatically generating fixation-location data over time at high temporal resolution. Often, the researcher obtains a binary measure of whether or not, at each point in time, the participant is fixating on a critical interest area or object in the real world or in a computerized display. Eye-tracking data are characterized by spatial-temporal correlations and random variability, driven by multiple fine-grained observations taken over small time intervals (e.g., every 10 ms). Ignoring these data complexities leads to biased inferences for the covariates of interest such as experimental condition effects. This article presents a novel application of a generalized additive logistic regression model for intensive binary time series eye-tracking data from a between- and within-subjects experimental design. The model is formulated as a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) and implemented in the mgcv R package. The generalized additive logistic regression model was illustrated using an empirical data set aimed at understanding the accommodation of regional accents in spoken language processing. Accuracy of parameter estimates and the importance of modeling the spatial-temporal correlations in detecting the experimental condition effects were shown in conditions similar to our empirical data set via a simulation study.

From the current authors' perspective, such an assessment results in premature closure on the relationship between the two subdisciplines, as we in the humanistic tradition continue to appreciate and place our trust in the power of dialogue. Psychologists on both sides of this epistemological boundary might therefore benefit from focusing on the possibilities offered by an interface between the two approaches rather than on a divide that is far more likely to push us apart.},

Methods Data were from the 1958 British Birth Cohort, a 45-year study of 98\% of births in 1 week in 1958 in England, Scotland, and Wales. Outcomes included International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnoses for affective and anxiety disorders at 45 years and psychopathology at 16 years and 23 years. Multiple multi-informant measures of childhood adversity were available at 7, 11, and 16 years, with additional retrospective measures of parental sexual and physical abuse at 45 years. Analyses were determined on the basis of N = 9377; 59\% of the surviving sample. Results After adjustment for socioeconomic covariates, childhood adversities were associated with adolescent, early adulthood, and mid-life psychopathology: most associations did not attenuate with age. Mid-life associations were significantly fully or partially mediated by early adulthood psychopathology: cumulative adversity, illness, sexual abuse, and physical abuse remained significantly associated with mid-life psychopathology. Conclusions The findings confirm the importance of preventing exposure to adversity and suggest that effects of adversity on mid-life psychopathology may operate through psychopathology in early adulthood. Future research is needed to examine other intermediary factors which may explain these associations.},

  abstract = {Generalised additive models (GAMs) are increasingly popular tools for estimating smooth nonlinear relationships between predictors and response variables. GAMs are particularly relevant in ecology for representing hierarchical functions for discrete responses that encompass complex features including zero inflation, truncation and uneven sampling. However, GAMs are less useful for producing forecasts as their smooth functions provide unstable predictions outside the range of training data. We introduce dynamic generalised additive models (DGAMs), where the GAM linear predictor is jointly estimated with unobserved dynamic components to model time series that evolve as a function of nonlinear predictor associations and latent temporal processes. These models are especially useful for analysing multiple series, as they can estimate hierarchical smooth functions while learning complex temporal associations via dimension-reduced latent factor processes. We implement our models in the mvgam R package, which estimates unobserved parameters for smoothing splines and latent temporal processes in a probabilistic framework. Using simulations, we illustrate how our models outperform competing formulations in realistic ecological forecasting tasks while identifying important smooth predictor functions. We use a real-world case study to highlight some of mvgam's key features, which include functions for calculating correlations among series' latent trends, performing model selection using rolling window forecasts and posterior predictive checks, online data augmentation via a recursive particle filter and visualising probabilistic uncertainties for smooth functions and predictions. Dynamic GAMs (DGAMs) offer a solution to the challenge of forecasting discrete time series while estimating ecologically relevant nonlinear predictor associations. Our Bayesian latent factor approach will be particularly useful for exploring competing dynamic ecological models that encompass hierarchical smoothing structures while providing forecasts with robust uncertainties, tasks that are becoming increasingly important in applied ecology.},

  abstract = {Affect is central to human functioning. Due to its dynamic nature, it is often studied with intensive longitudinal designs, yet the development and validation of measures for this purpose have received little systematic attention. In the current study, we review theoretical and methodological conceptualizations of affect that are relevant for repeated momentary positive and negative affect measurement. We developed a questionnaire including six dimensional affect and 22 discrete emotion items that allowed us to measure alternative momentary affect constructs with single and multi-item scores. The items were operationalized into two bipolar, six positive, and six negative momentary affect measures. We compared the measures with three quantifiable criteria of construct validity: the amount of within-person variance, within-person sensitivity to emotional events, and between-person relations to depression and neuroticism. The criteria were empirically investigated with a preregistered experience sampling study (N = 153). We identify the measures with the strongest validity evidence across all criteria and evaluate their suitability for specific research questions, by looking at individual criteria. The overall findings provide strong evidence supporting the use of single-item measures of momentary affect. Furthermore, they provide an efficient low-burden assessment tool that is comparable across studies. For multi-item scales, it is recommended to combine discrete emotion items of similar intensity, while simply selecting and averaging discrete emotion items is problematic concerning our validity criteria. In the future, we encourage the field to conduct systematic research on the use and interpretation of scores that aggregate different emotion items together.},

I have learned to avoid the many misconceptions that surround Fisherian null hypothesis testing. I have also learned the importance of power analysis and the determination of just how big (rather than how statistically significant) are the effects that we study. Finally, I have learned that there is no royal road to statistical induction, that the informed judgment of the investigator is the crucial element in the interpretation of data, and that things take time.},

  abstract = {Rumination is a well-established vulnerability factor for depression that may exert deleterious effects both independently and in interaction with stress. The current study examined momentary ruminative self-focus (MRS) and stress-reactive rumination (SRR) as predictors of depressive symptoms utilizing a smartphone ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design. 121 undergraduates responded to four text message alerts per day for one week in which they indicated the occurrence of life stress, rumination, and depressed mood. SRR, but not MRS, independently predicted increases in depressive symptoms. MRS interacted with depressive symptoms to predict increases in symptoms at the subsequent timepoint, supporting the deleterious effects of depressive rumination on future mood state. Interactions emerged between stress and both MRS and SRR, such that experiencing higher levels of stressors and rumination at an observation predicted greater increases in depressive symptoms. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that state rumination moderates the effect of stress in predicting depressive symptoms using EMA methodology. Results suggest that rumination levels in response to stress vary within individuals and can have an important effect on depressed mood. Findings may have important clinical implications, as lessening individuals’ tendency to engage in rumination following stress may help to alleviate depressive symptoms.},

  abstract = {The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is widely-used to measure risk propensity in theoretical, clinical, and applied research. In the task, people choose either to pump a balloon to increase its value at the risk of the balloon bursting and losing all value, or to bank the current value of the balloon. Risk propensity is most commonly measured as the average number of pumps on trials for which the balloon does not burst. Burst trials are excluded because they necessarily underestimate the number of pumps people intended to make. However, their exclusion discards relevant information about people’s risk propensity. A better measure of risk propensity uses the statistical method of censoring to incorporate all of the trials. We develop a new Bayesian method, based on censoring, for measuring both risk propensity and behavioral consistency in the BART. Through applications to previous data we demonstrate how the method can be extended to consider the correlation of risk propensity with external measures, and to compare differences in risk propensity between groups. We provide implementations of all of these methods in R, MATLAB, and the GUI-based statistical software JASP.},

In this paper, we argue that a multivariate approach more effectively highlights the multifaceted structure and correlates of human mate preferences. To support this claim, we applied several multivariate techniques to data from a large adult sample to (1) examine the major dimensions underlying individual differences in mate preferences, and (2) elucidate how these preferences relate to individual differences in personality. An exploratory factor analysis of an omnibus mate preference questionnaire yielded a 14-factor solution with dimensions mirroring trends in evolutionary psychology and the Big Five personality framework. An inter-battery factor analysis of these dimensions paired with higher-order personality factors provided strong support for the “likes attract” model of partner preferences. Bootstrap confidence intervals for all factor loadings highlighted the robustness of our results.},

  abstract = {Suicide is one of the most devastating aspects of human nature and has puzzled scholars for thousands of years. Most suicide research to date has focused on establishing the prevalence and predictors of the presence or severity of suicidal thoughts/behaviors. Surprisingly little research has documented the fundamental properties of suicidal thoughts/behaviors, such as: when someone has a suicidal thought, how long do such thoughts last? Documenting the basic properties of a phenomenon is necessary to understand, study, and treat it. This study aims to identify the timescale of suicidal thinking, leveraging novel real-time monitoring data and a number of different novel analytic approaches. Participants were 105 adults with past week suicidal thoughts who completed a 42-day real-time monitoring study (total number of observations=20,255). Participants completed two forms of real time assessments: traditional real-time assessments (spaced hours apart each day) and high-frequency assessments (spaced 10 minutes apart over one hour). We found that suicidal thinking changes rapidly. Both descriptive statistics and Markov-Switching models indicated that that elevated states of suicidal thinking lasted on average 1 to 3 hours. Individuals exhibited considerable heterogeneity in how often and for how long they reported elevated suicidal thinking, and our analyses suggest that different aspects of suicidal thinking operated on different timescales. Continuous-time autoregressive models suggest that current suicidal intent is predictive of future intent levels for 2 to 3 hours, while current suicidal desire predictive of future suicidal desire levels for 20 hours. Multiple models found that elevated suicidal intent has on average shorter duration than elevated suicidal desire. Finally, our ability to capture within-person dynamics of suicidal thinking was improved using high-frequency sampling. For example, traditional real-time assessments alone estimated the duration of severe suicidal states of suicidal desire as 9.5 hours, whereas, the high-frequency assessments shifted the estimated duration to 1.4 hours. The high-frequency assessments identified 19\% more participants with a high-risk response than the traditional real-time assessment, and high frequency measurements were shown to capture considerable levels of variation across consecutive measurement occasions. These results provide the most detailed characterization to date of the temporal dynamics of suicidal thinking. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of sampling frequency in capturing the dynamics of a phenomenon.},

Objective: Review the latest available literature regarding diagnoses similarities, presentation uniqueness, assessment/assessment tools, and suggested treatments of ON. Method/Design: A literature search of four databases focusing on articles published between 2000 and 2016 was conducted to evaluate the status of the literature on Orthorexia. Results: Among the 15 articles selected for this review, similarities with other psychiatric disorders emerged, confusion about use of assessment tools existed, and the lack of evidence based treatments for ON was pronounced. Conclusion: More research is needed to determine the prevalence of pathologically unhealthy, obsessive, “self-defined healthy,” eating behaviors, and to determine if ON is a unique eating disorder or just a subset of another disorder.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we characterize major depression (MD) as a complex dynamic system in which symptoms (e.g., insomnia and fatigue) are directly connected to one another in a network structure. We hypothesize that individuals can be characterized by their own network with unique architecture and resulting dynamics. With respect to architecture, we show that individuals vulnerable to developing MD are those with strong connections between symptoms: e.g., only one night of poor sleep suffices to make a particular person feel tired. Such vulnerable networks, when pushed by forces external to the system such as stress, are more likely to end up in a depressed state; whereas networks with weaker connections tend to remain in or return to a non-depressed state. We show this with a simulation in which we model the probability of a symptom becoming ‘active’ as a logistic function of the activity of its neighboring symptoms. Additionally, we show that this model potentially explains some well-known empirical phenomena such as spontaneous recovery as well as accommodates existing theories about the various subtypes of MD. To our knowledge, we offer the first intra-individual, symptom-based, process model with the potential to explain the pathogenesis and maintenance of major depression.},

  abstract = {Objective Meta-analyses of psychotherapies usually report effects sizes, while clinicians and patients need to know the proportion of patients who benefit from therapy. We conducted a meta-analysis of therapies for depression reporting the rates of response (50\% symptom reduction), remission (HAM-D {$<$}7), clinical significant deterioration for psychotherapy, and control conditions (CAU, waitlist, and pill placebo), as well as the relative risk of these outcomes and the numbers-needed-to-be-treated (NNTs). Methods We searched bibliographic databases and included 228 randomized trials comparing psychotherapy for depression against control conditions (75 with low risk of bias). Only therapies with at least 10 trials were included. We extracted outcomes from the studies, and for those studies not reporting the outcomes, we used a validated method to estimate the rates. Results The overall response rate in psychotherapies at 2 (±1) months after baseline was 41\% (95\% CI: 38 43), 17\% (15 20) for usual care (CAU), and 16\% (95\% CI: 14 18) for waitlist. No significant differences between types of therapy were found. The NNT for therapy versus CAU was 5.3 and versus waitlist 3.9. About one third of patients remitted after therapy compared with 7\%–13\% in control conditions. The rates of deterioration were 5\% versus 12\%–13\%, respectively. Most sensitivity analyses supported the general findings. Conclusion Psychotherapies for depression may be effective compared with control conditions, but more than half of patients receiving therapy do not respond and only one third remitted. More effective treatments and treatment strategies such as sequencing and combining treatments are clearly needed.},

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing two psychotherapies directly in a group of depressed patients with a specific characteristic. We focused on the six most examined types of psychotherapy for adult depression. Our searches resulted in 41 studies with 2,741 patients who met inclusion criteria. These 41 studies examined 27 specific characteristics of patients. Power calculations indicated that we would need 4 studies for each characteristic to find a clinically relevant effect size set at g = 0.50 and 16 studies for an effect size of 0.24. Only 3 patient characteristics were found to have sufficient power and to significantly moderate treatment outcomes. Cognitive-behavioral therapy was found to be more effective than other therapies in older adults (g = 0.29), in patients with comorbid addictive disorders (g = 0.31), and in university students (g = 0.46). Risk of bias was considerable in most of the included studies. It was estimated that it will take another 326 years to have sufficient statistical power for showing an effect size of g = 0.50 of the 27 characteristics, and 1,372 years to show an effect size of 0.24. Although several dozens of studies have compared the effects of psychotherapies in specific target groups, we will need to develop more powerful alternatives to comparative outcome studies in order to identify personalized treatments for depression.},

Many researchers use landscapes as a metaphor to illustrate the concept of stability, but so far there is no method to quantify the stability of a system’s phases. We here propose a method to construct the potential landscape for multivariate psychological models. This method is based on the generalized potential function defined by Wang et al. (2008) and Monte Carlo simulation. Based on potential landscapes we define three different types of stability for psychological phases: absolute stability, relative stability, and geometric stability. The panic disorder model by Robinaugh et al. (2019) is used as an example, to demonstrate how the method can be used to quantify the stability of states and phases, illustrate the influence of model parameters, and guide model modifications. An R package, simlandr, was developed to provide an implementation of the method.},

  abstract = {Introduction Major depressive disorder is one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric illnesses, and it has a profound negative impact on an individual's ability to function. Up to 90\% of individuals suffering from depression also report sleep and circadian disruptions. If these disruptions are not effectively resolved over the course of treatment, the likelihood of relapse into depression is greatly increased. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has shown promise in treating these sleep and circadian disturbances associated with depression, and may be effective as a stand-alone treatment for depression. This may be particularly relevant in cases where antidepressant medications are not ideal (e.g. due to contraindications, cost, or treatment resistance). Methods A systematic literature review was conducted of trials investigating the use of CBT-I to treat depression in adults. Therapy included in-person CBT-I, as well as telehealth and group CBT-I. Results and conclusions CBT-I presents a promising treatment for depression comorbid with insomnia. In-person therapy has the most supporting evidence for its efficacy, though treatment effects may not be additive with those of antidepressant medications. Insomnia improvement due to CBT-I may mediate the improvement in depressive symptoms. There is less evidence for the use of telehealth, though a stepped-care approach is indicated based on baseline depressive severity. More research on group therapy and telehealth modalities of delivering CBT-I are required before making recommendations.},

  abstract = {Background The network approach to psychopathology has become increasingly popular. Little research has examined the dynamic network structure of mental disorders, and, to date, no study has investigated the network dynamics of positive affect, negative affect, and physical activity in bipolar disorder. This represents the first study to estimate the dynamic network structure of affect and physical activity in individuals with and without bipolar I disorder. Methods An intensive longitudinal design was used to assess positive affect, negative affect, and actigraphy-based estimates of physical activity. The overall sample consisted of 32 adults with bipolar I disorder and 36 healthy control participants. Eligible participants underwent an 8-week assessment period, in which once-per-day ratings of affect and actigraphy estimates were obtained. Participants were re-assessed on baseline measures afterwards. Dynamic network analysis was used to examine the network structure of affect and physical activity over time. Multilevel models were used to examine the relationship between autocorrelation and changes in depression symptoms among participants with bipolar disorder. Limitations The network analyses assume stationarity. Future research should consider time-varying multilevel network models to better account for time trends. Results The results of the temporal networks indicated that the directed edges between positive and negative affect were mostly positive among individuals with bipolar I disorder. Among healthy control participants, the directed edges between positive and negative affect were mostly negative in direction. Physical activity, as assessed by daily actigraphy indices, was more densely connected in the healthy control network than the bipolar disorder network. Furthermore, the results indicated that critical slowing down predicted worsening of mood symptoms in the bipolar I disorder group. Conclusions This study suggests that certain dynamic patterns of affect may be an underlying process that contributes to the maintenance of bipolar disorder. These results have both theoretical and practical implications.},

  abstract = {Item selection is a critical decision in modeling psychological networks. The current pre-registered two-study research used random selections of 1,000 symptom networks to examine which eating disorder (ED) and co-occurring symptoms are most central in longitudinal networks among individuals with EDs (N = 71, total observations = 6,060) and tested whether centrality changed based on which items were included in the network. Participants completed two weeks of ecological momentary assessment (EMA; 5 surveys/day). In Study 1, we obtained initial strength centrality values by estimating an a-priori network using eight items with the highest means. We then estimated 1,000 networks and their centrality from a random selection of unique 8-item symptom combinations. We compared the strength centrality from the a-priori network to the distribution of strength centrality estimates from the random-item networks. In Study 2, we repeated this procedure in an independent longitudinal dataset (N=41, total observations=4,575) to determine if our results generalized across samples. Shame, guilt, worry, and fear of losing control were consistently central across networks, regardless of items included in the network or sample. Results suggest that these symptoms may be important to the structure of ED psychopathology and have implications for how we understand the structure of ED psychopathology. Existing methods for item inclusion in psychological networks may distort the structure of ED symptom networks by either under- or overestimating strength centrality, or by omitting consistently central symptoms that are non-traditional ED symptoms. Future research should consider including these symptoms in models of ED psychopathology.},

  abstract = {Many real-world systems can exhibit tipping points and multiple stable states, creating the potential for sudden and difficult to reverse transitions into a less desirable regime. The theory of dynamical systems points to the existence of generic early warning signals that may precede these so-called critical transitions. Recently, psychologists have begun to conceptualize mental disorders such as depression as an alternative stable state, and suggested that early warning signals based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down might be useful for predicting transitions into depression and other psychiatric disorders. Harnessing the potential of early warning signals requires us to understand their limitations as well as the factors influencing their performance in practice. In this article, we (a) review limitations of early warning signals based on critical slowing down to better understand when they can and cannot occur, and (b) study the conditions under which early warning signals may anticipate critical transitions in online-monitoring settings by simulating from a bistable dynamical system, varying crucial features such as sampling frequency, noise intensity, and speed of approaching the tipping point. We find that, in sharp contrast to their reputation of being generic or model-agnostic, whether early warning signals occur or not strongly depends on the specifics of the system. We also find that they are very sensitive to noise, potentially limiting their utility in practical applications. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide suggestions and recommendations for future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Time series of individual subjects have become a common data type in psychological research. The Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, which predicts each variable by all variables including itself at previous time points, has become a popular modeling choice for these data. However, the number of observations in typical psychological applications is often small, which puts the reliability of VAR coefficients into question. In such situations it is possible that the simpler AR model, which only predicts each variable by itself at previous time points, is more appropriate. Bulteel et al. (2018) used empirical data to investigate in which situations the AR or VAR models are more appropriate and suggest a rule to choose between the two models in practice. We provide an extended analysis of these issues using a simulation study. This allows us to (1) directly investigate the relative performance of AR and VAR models in typical psychological applications, (2) show how the relative performance depends both on n and characteristics of the true model, (3) quantify the uncertainty in selecting between the two models, and (4) assess the relative performance of different model selection strategies. We thereby provide a more complete picture for applied researchers about when the VAR model is appropriate in typical psychological applications, and how to select between AR and VAR models in practice.},

  abstract = {Testing the equality of two proportions is a common procedure in science, especially in medicine and public health. In these domains, it is crucial to be able to quantify evidence for the absence of a treatment effect. Bayesian hypothesis testing by means of the Bayes factor provides one avenue to do so, requiring the specification of prior distributions for parameters. The most popular analysis approach views the comparison of proportions from a contingency table perspective, assigning prior distributions directly to the two proportions. Another, less popular approach views the problem from a logistic regression perspective, assigning prior distributions to logit-transformed parameters. Reanalyzing 39 null results from the New England Journal of Medicine with both approaches, we find that they can lead to markedly different conclusions, especially when the observed proportions are at the extremes (ie, very low or very high). We explain these stark differences and provide recommendations for researchers interested in testing the equality of two proportions and users of Bayes factors more generally. The test that assigns prior distributions to logit-transformed parameters creates prior dependence between the two proportions and yields weaker evidence when the observations are at the extremes. When comparing two proportions, we argue that this test should become the new default.},

  abstract = {“Which variables are important?” is a key question in science and statistics. In this blog post, I focus on linear models and discuss a Bayesian solution to this problem using spike-and-slab priors and the Gibbs sampler, a computational method to sample from a joint distribution using only conditional distributions. Variable selection is a beast. To slay it, we must draw on ideas from different fields. We have to discuss the basics of Bayesian inference which motivates our principal weapon, the Gibbs sampler. As an instruction manual, we apply it to a simple example: drawing samples from a bivariate Gaussian distribution (for pre-combat exercises, see here). The Gibbs sampler feeds on conditional distributions. To be able to derive those easily, we need to equip ourselves with \$d\$-separation and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Having trained and become stronger, we attack variable selection in the linear regression case using Gibbs sampling with spike-and-slab priors. These priors are special in that they are a discrete mixture of a Dirac delta function — which can shrink regression coefficients exactly to zero — and a Gaussian distribution. We tackle the single predictor case first, and then generalize it to \$p {$>$} 1\$ predictors. For \$p\$ predictors, the Gibbs sampler with spike-and-slab priors yields a posterior distribution over all possible \$2\^p\$ regression models, an enormous feat. From this, posterior inclusion probabilities and model-averaged parameter estimates follow straightforwardly. To wield this weapon in practice, we implement the method in R and engage in variable selection on simulated and real data. Seems like we have a lot to cover, so let’s get started! Quantifying uncertainty Bayesian inference is an excellent tool for uncertainty quantification. Assume you have assigned a prior distribution to some parameter \$\textbackslash beta\$ of a model \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\$, call it \$p(\textbackslash beta \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathcal\{M\})\$. After you have observed data \$\textbackslash mathbf\{y\}\$, how should you update your belief to arrive at the posterior, \$p(\textbackslash beta \textbackslash mid y, \textbackslash mathcal\{M\})\$? The rules of probability dictate: [\textbackslash underbrace\{p(\textbackslash beta \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\}, \textbackslash mathcal\{M\})\}\{\textbackslash text\{Posterior\}\} = \textbackslash underbrace\{p(\textbackslash beta \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathcal\{M\})\}\{\textbackslash text\{Prior\}\} \textbackslash times \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash overbrace\{p(\textbackslash mathbf\{y\} \textbackslash mid \textbackslash beta, \textbackslash mathcal\{M\})\}\^\{\textbackslash text\{Likelihood\}\}\}\{\textbackslash underbrace\{\textbackslash int p(\textbackslash mathbf\{y\} \textbackslash mid \textbackslash beta, \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}) \textbackslash, p(\textbackslash beta \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}) \textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{d\} \textbackslash beta\}\_\{\textbackslash text\{Marginal Likelihood\}\}\} \textbackslash enspace .] The computationally easy parts of the right-hand side is the specification of the prior and, unless you do crazy things, also the likelihood. The tough bit is the marginal likelihood or normalizing constant which, as the name implies, makes the posterior distribution integrate to one, as all proper probability distributions must. In contrast to differentiation, which is a local operation, integration is a global operation and is thus much harder. It becomes even harder with many parameters. Usually, Bayes’ rule is given without conditioning on the model, \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\$. However, this assumes that we know one model to be true with certainty, thus ignoring the uncertainty we have about the models. We can apply Bayes’ rule not only on parameters, but also on models: [p(\textbackslash mathcal\{M\} \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\}) = p(\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}) \textbackslash times \textbackslash frac\{p(\textbackslash mathbf\{y\} \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathcal\{M\})\}\{\textbackslash sum\_\{i = 1\}\^m p(\textbackslash mathbf\{y\} \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_i) \textbackslash, p(\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_i)\} \textbackslash enspace ,] where \$m\$ is the number of all models and [p(\textbackslash mathbf\{y\} \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}) = \textbackslash int p(\textbackslash mathbf\{y\} \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}, \textbackslash beta) \textbackslash, p(\textbackslash beta \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}) \textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{d\} \textbackslash beta \textbackslash enspace ,] is in fact the marginal likelihood of our first equation. To illustrate how one could do variable selection, assume we have two models, \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_1\$ and \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_2\$, which differ in their number of predictors: [\textbackslash begin\{aligned\} \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_2\&: \textbackslash mathbf\{y\} = \textbackslash beta\_0 + \textbackslash beta\_1 \textbackslash mathbf\{x\}\_1 \textbackslash [0.5em] \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_4\&: \textbackslash mathbf\{y\} = \textbackslash beta\_0 + \textbackslash beta\_1 \textbackslash mathbf\{x\}\_1 + \textbackslash beta\_2 \textbackslash mathbf\{x\}\_2 \textbackslash enspace . \textbackslash end\{aligned\}] If these two are the only models we consider, then we can quantify their respective merits using posterior odds: [\textbackslash underbrace\{\textbackslash frac\{p(\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}4 \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\})\}\{p(\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_2 \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\})\}\}\{\textbackslash text\{Posterior Odds\}\} = \textbackslash underbrace\{\textbackslash frac\{p(\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}4)\}\{p(\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_2)\}\}\{\textbackslash text\{Prior Odds\}\} \textbackslash times \textbackslash underbrace\{\textbackslash frac\{p(\textbackslash mathbf\{y\} \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}4)\}\{p(\textbackslash mathbf\{y\} \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_2)\}\}\{\textbackslash text\{Bayes factor\}\} \textbackslash enspace ,] where we can interpret the Bayes factor as an indicator for how much more likely the data are under \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_4\$, which includes \$\textbackslash beta\_2\$, compared to \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_2\$, which does not include \$\textbackslash beta\_2\$. However, two additional regression models are possible: [\textbackslash begin\{aligned\} \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_1\&: \textbackslash mathbf\{y\} = \textbackslash beta\_0\textbackslash [0.5em] \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_3\&: \textbackslash mathbf\{y\} = \textbackslash beta\_0 + \textbackslash beta\_2 \textbackslash mathbf\{x\}\_2 \textbackslash enspace . \textbackslash end\{aligned\}] In general, if \$p\$ is the number of predictors, then there are \$2\^p\$ possible regression models in total. If we ignore some of those a priori, we will have violated Cromwell’s rule, which states that we should never assign prior probabilities of zero to things that could possibly happen. Otherwise, regardless of the evidence, we would never change our mind. As Dennis Lindley put it, we should “[…] leave a little probability for the moon being made of green cheese; it can be as small as 1 in a million, but have it there since otherwise an army of astronauts returning with samples of the said cheese will leave you unmoved.” (Lindley, 1991, p. 101) One elegant aspect about the Bayes factor is that we do not need to compute the normalizing constant of all models (it cancels in the ratio), which would require us to enumerate and assign priors to all possible models. If we are willing to do this, however, then we can model-average to get a posterior distribution of \$\textbackslash beta\_j\$ that takes into account the uncertainty about all \$m\$ models: [\textbackslash begin\{aligned\} p(\textbackslash beta\_j \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\}) \&= \textbackslash sum\_\{i=1\}\^m \textbackslash, p(\textbackslash beta\_j, \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}i \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\}) \textbackslash [.5em] \&= \textbackslash sum\{i=1\}\^m \textbackslash, p(\textbackslash beta\_j \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\}, \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_i) \textbackslash, p(\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_i \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\}) \textbackslash enspace , \textbackslash end\{aligned\}] which requires computing the posterior distribution over the parameter of interest \$\textbackslash beta\_j\$ in each model \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_j\$, as well as the posterior distribution over all such models. Needless to say, this is a difficult problem; the bulk of this blog post is to find an efficient way to do this in the context of linear regression models. For variable selection, we might be interested in another quantity: the posterior probability that \$\textbackslash beta\_j \textbackslash neq 0\$, averaged over all models. We can arrive at this by similar means: [\textbackslash begin\{aligned\} p(\textbackslash beta\_j \textbackslash neq 0 \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\}) \& = \textbackslash sum\_\{i=1\}\^m \textbackslash, p(\textbackslash beta\_j \textbackslash neq 0, \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}i \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\}) \textbackslash [.5em] \&= \textbackslash sum\{i=1\}\^m \textbackslash, p(\textbackslash beta\_j \textbackslash neq 0 \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\}, \textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_i) \textbackslash, p(\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_i \textbackslash mid \textbackslash mathbf\{y\}) \textbackslash enspace . \textbackslash end\{aligned\}] Note that conditional on a model \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_i\$, \$\textbackslash beta\_j\$ is either zero or not zero. Therefore, all the terms in which \$\textbackslash beta\_j\$ is zero drop out of the sum, and we are left with summing the posterior model probabilities for the models in which \$\textbackslash beta\_j \textbackslash neq 0\$. This model-averaging perspective strikes me as a very elegant approach to variable selection.1 In the remainder of this blog post, we will solve this variable selection problem for linear regression using the Gibbs sampler with spike-and-slab priors. Gibbs sampling Much of the advent in Bayesian inference in the last few decades is due to methods that arrive at the posterior distribution without calculating the marginal likelihood. One such method is the Gibbs sampler, which breaks down a high-dimensional problem into a number of smaller low-dimensional problems. It’s really one of the coolest things in statistics: it samples from the joint posterior distribution and its marginals by sampling from the conditional posterior distributions. To prove that it works mathematically is not trivial, and beyond this already lengthy introductory blog post.2 Thus, instead of getting bogged down in the technical details, let’s take a look at a motivating example. Sampling from a bivariate Gaussian To illlustrate, let \$X\_1\$ and \$X\_2\$ be bivariate normally distributed random variables with population mean zero (\$\textbackslash mu\_1 = \textbackslash mu\_2 = 0\$), unit variance (\$\textbackslash sigma\_1\^2 = \textbackslash sigma\_2\^2 = 1\$), and correlation \$\textbackslash rho\$. As you may recall from a previous blogpost, the conditional Gaussian distribution of \$X\_1\$ given \$X\_2 = x\_2\$, and \$X\_2\$ given \$X\_1 = x\_1\$, respectively, are: [\textbackslash begin\{aligned\} X\_1 \textbackslash mid X\_2 = x\_2 \&\textbackslash sim \textbackslash mathcal\{N\}\textbackslash left(\textbackslash rho x\_2, \textbackslash, (1 - \textbackslash rho\^2)\textbackslash right) \textbackslash [0.5em] X\_2 \textbackslash mid X\_1 = x\_1 \&\textbackslash sim \textbackslash mathcal\{N\}\textbackslash left(\textbackslash rho x\_1, \textbackslash, (1 - \textbackslash rho\^2)\textbackslash right) \textbackslash enspace . \textbackslash end\{aligned\}] The Gibbs sampler makes it so that if we sample repeatedly from these two conditional distributions: [(x\_1\^1, x\_2\^1), (x\_1\^2, x\_2\^2), \textbackslash ldots, (x\_1\^\{n - 1\}, x\_2\^\{n - 1\}), (x\_1\^n, x\_2\^n) \textbackslash enspace ,] then these will be samples from the joint distribution \$p(X\_1, X\_2)\$ and its marginals. To illustrate, we implement this Gibbs sampler in R. For a very concise overview of variable selection, see George (2004). For a good overview of model uncertainty, see Clyde \& George (2004).

  abstract = {For most neuroimaging questions the range of possible analytic choices makes it unclear how to evaluate conclusions from any single analytic method. One possible way to address this issue is to evaluate all possible analyses using a multiverse approach, however, this can be computationally challenging and sequential analyses on the same data can compromise predictive power. Here, we establish how active learning on a low-dimensional space capturing the inter-relationships between pipelines can efficiently approximate the full spectrum of analyses. This approach balances the benefits of a multiverse analysis without incurring the cost on computational and predictive power. We illustrate this approach with two functional MRI datasets (predicting brain age and autism diagnosis) demonstrating how a multiverse of analyses can be efficiently navigated and mapped out using active learning. Furthermore, our presented approach not only identifies the subset of analysis techniques that are best able to predict age or classify individuals with autism spectrum disorder and healthy controls, but it also allows the relationships between analyses to be quantified.},

Observational human studies and experimental animal models suggest that childhood exposure to stress can trigger an enduring systemic inflammatory response not unlike the bodily response to physical injury. In turn, these “hidden wounds” of childhood trauma can affect brain development, key behavioral domains (e.g., cognition, positive valence systems, negative valence systems), reactivity to subsequent stressors, and, ultimately, risk for psychopathology. Further research is needed to better characterize the inflammatory links between childhood trauma and psychopathology. Detecting and healing these hidden wounds may help prevent and treat psychopathology emerging after childhood trauma.},

It then offers a review and discussion of empirical findings regarding the effects of client and therapist attachment patterns on process and outcome in individual psychotherapy with adults. Empirical studies have linked adult attachment patterns to differences in client and therapist in-treatment behaviour, to differences in the quality and development of the therapeutic alliance, and to differences in therapeutic outcome.

Sixty-nine women and 1 man of a mean age of 25.8 years diagnosed with BN were randomly assigned to either 2 years of weekly PPT or 5 months of CBT. Assessments at intake, after 5 months, and after 2 years included the Eating Disorder Examination to assess eating disorder symptoms, the Adult Attachment Interview to assess client attachment, and the Symptom Checklist 90-R to assess general psychiatric distress. Repeated measures were analyzed using multilevel analysis. Higher scores on attachment insecurity and attachment preoccupation were associated with more frequent binging pretreatment. Pretreatment attachment did not predict treatment outcome. In PPT, but not in CBT, reduction of binging was associated with an increase in attachment security. The 2 treatment types were not associated with significantly different patterns of attachment-related change. Degree and type of attachment insecurity is related to the frequency of binging in BN. Increase in attachment security may be a treatment-specific mechanism of change in PPT for BN. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Resilience is the process that allows individuals to adapt to adverse conditions and recover from them. This process is favored by individual qualities that have been amply studied in the field of stress such as personal control, positive affect, optimism, and social support. Biopsychosocial studies on the individual qualities that promote resilience show that these factors help protect against the deleterious influences of stressors on physiology in general and immunity in particular. The reverse is also true as there is evidence that immune processes influence resilience. Most of the data supporting this relationship comes from animal studies on individual differences in the ability to resist situations of chronic stress. These data build on the knowledge that has accumulated on the influence of immune factors on brain and behavior in both animal and human studies. In general, resilient individuals have a different immunophenotype from that of stress susceptible individuals. It is possible to render susceptible individuals resilient and vice versa by changing their inflammatory phenotype. The adaptive immune phenotype also influences the ability to recover from inflammation-induced symptoms. The modulation of these bidirectional relationships between resilience and immunity by the gut microbiota opens the possibility to influence them by probiotics and prebiotics. However, more focused studies on the reciprocal relationship between resilience and immunity will be necessary before this can be put into practice.},

But these tend to represent the psychological facet of mental states, which might not align with the physiological facet of that state. Our paper demonstrates that when what people “feel” difers from what people “say they feel”, we witness a semantic gap that limits predictions. We show that predicting mental wellbeing with passive data (ofine sensors or online social media) is related to how the ground-truth is measured (objective arousal or self-report). Features with psychosocial signals (e.g., language) were better at predicting self-reported anxiety and stress. Conversely, features with behavioral signals (e.g., sleep), were better at predicting stressful arousal. Regardless of the source of ground truth, integrating both signals boosted prediction. To reduce the semantic gap, we provide recommendations to evaluate ground truth measures and adopt parsimonious sensing.},

Although several studies using this approach have examined comorbidity between disorders using cross-sectional samples, a direct application of the network analysis approach to intraindividual dynamic relations between symptoms in a complex, comorbid case has not been reported. The current article describes an intraindividual dynamic network analysis (IDNA) approach to understanding the psychopathology of an individual using dynamic (over time) lead-lag interrelations between symptoms. Multivariate time series data were utilized to create and examine an intraindividual, lag-1 network of the partial, day-to-day relations of symptoms in an individual with comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. Characteristics of the network, including centrality indices, stability, dynamic processes between symptoms, and their implications for clinical assessment are described. Additional clinical implications and future directions for IDNA, including the potential incremental validity of this assessment approach for empirically-based idiographic assessment and personalized treatment planning, are discussed. This person-specific IDNA approach may be especially useful in complex and comorbid cases.},

Finding objective outcomes, which reliably measure sleep in bipolar disorders, is essential in developing better therapies and improving follow-up monitoring strategies. Our aim is to understand the role of actigraphy as an objective measure of sleep in bipolar disorder. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis on studies using actigraphy to detect changes in activity and sleep patterns in bipolar patients versus healthy controls. The primary outcome measures were the analyses of ‘activity mean’ and ‘sleep duration’. As secondary outcomes we analysed ‘sleep onset latency’, ‘sleep efficiency’, and ’time awake after sleep onset’. Thirteen studies comprising 821 subjects met quality criteria for inclusion. The results show a decrease in activity mean and an altered pattern of sleep in bipolar patients. Further analyses suggest that the results might be generalized to a bipolar condition which underlies manic and depressed episodes as well as euthymic phases. This study highlights the role of actigraphy as an important objective tool for the ambulatory monitoring of sleep and activity in bipolar disorders.},

  abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in the use of intensive longitudinal research designs to study within-person processes. Examples are studies that use experience sampling data and autoregressive modeling to investigate emotion dynamics and between-person differences therein. Such designs often involve multiple measurements per day and multiple days per person, and it is not clear how this nesting of the data should be accounted for: That is, should such data be considered as two-level data (which is common practice at this point), with occasions nested in persons, or as three-level data with beeps nested in days which are nested in persons. We show that a significance test of the day-level variance in an empty three-level model is not reliable when there is autocorrelation. Furthermore, we show that misspecifying the number of levels can lead to spurious or misleading findings, such as inflated variance or autoregression estimates. Throughout the paper we present instructions and R code for the implementation of the proposed models, which includes a novel three-level AR(1) model that estimates moment-to-moment inertia and day-to-day inertia. Based on our simulations we recommend model selection using autoregressive multilevel models in combination with the AIC. We illustrate this method using empirical emotion data from two independent samples, and discuss the implications and the relevance of the existence of a day level for the field.},

  abstract = {Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps aim at providing seamless access to tailored health information technology and have the potential to alleviate global health burdens. Yet, they bear risks to information security and privacy because users need to reveal private, sensitive medical information to redeem certain benefits. Due to the plethora and diversity of available mHealth apps, implications for information security and privacy are unclear and complex. Objective: The objective of this study was to establish an overview of mHealth apps offered on iOS and Android with a special focus on potential damage to users through information security and privacy infringements. Methods: We assessed apps available in English and offered in the categories “Medical” and “Health \& Fitness” in the iOS and Android App Stores. Based on the information retrievable from the app stores, we established an overview of available mHealth apps, tagged apps to make offered information machine-readable, and clustered the discovered apps to identify and group similar apps. Subsequently, information security and privacy implications were assessed based on health specificity of information available to apps, potential damage through information leaks, potential damage through information manipulation, potential damage through information loss, and potential value of information to third parties. Results: We discovered 24,405 health-related apps (iOS; 21,953; Android; 2452). Absence or scarceness of ratings for 81.36\% (17,860/21,953) of iOS and 76.14\% (1867/2452) of Android apps indicates that less than a quarter of mHealth apps are in more or less widespread use. Clustering resulted in 245 distinct clusters, which were consolidated into 12 app archetypes grouping clusters with similar assessments of potential damage through information security and privacy infringements. There were 6426 apps that were excluded during clustering. The majority of apps (95.63\%, 17,193/17,979; of apps) pose at least some potential damage through information security and privacy infringements. There were 11.67\% (2098/17,979) of apps that scored the highest assessments of potential damages. Conclusions: Various kinds of mHealth apps collect and offer critical, sensitive, private medical information, calling for a special focus on information security and privacy of mHealth apps. In order to foster user acceptance and trust, appropriate security measures and processes need to be devised and employed so that users can benefit from seamlessly accessible, tailored mHealth apps without exposing themselves to the serious repercussions of information security and privacy infringements.},

However, to minimize participant burden, ESM researchers often use single-item measures, preventing a reliability assessment of people’s emotion ratings. Furthermore, because emotions constantly change, checking reliability via conventional test–retest procedures is impractical, for it is impossible to separate measurement error from meaningful emotional variability. Here, drawing from classical test theory (CTT), we propose two time-varying test–retest adaptations to evaluate the reliability of single-item (emotion) measures in ESM. Following Method 1, we randomly repeat one emotion item within the same momentary survey and evaluate the discrepancy between test and retest ratings to determine reliability. Following Method 2, we introduce a subsequent, shortly delayed retest survey and extrapolate the size of test–retest discrepancies to the hypothetical instance where no time between assessments would exist. First, in an analytical study, we establish the mathematical relation between observed test–retest discrepancies and measurement error variance for both methods, based on common assumptions in the CTT literature. Second, in two empirical studies, we apply both methods to real-life emotion time series and find that the size of error in people’s emotion ratings corresponds with almost a 10th of the scale, comprising around 27\% of the total variability in participants’ affective responses. Consequently, disregarding measurement error in ESM is problematic, and we encourage researchers to include a test–retest procedure in their future studies when relying on single-item measures.

Here, we examine the proposition that the nature of the relation between positive and negative affect in a person’s emotional experience is indicative of psychological well-being, in particular the experience of depressive symptoms, typically characterized by diminished positive affect (anhedonia) and increased negative affect (depressed mood). In three experience sampling studies, we examine how positive and negative affective states are related within people’s emotional experience in daily life and how the degree of bipolarity of this relation is associated with depressive symptom severity. In Study 1 and 2, we show both concurrently and longitudinally that a stronger bipolar PA–NA relationship is associated with, and in fact is predicted by, higher depressive symptom severity, even after controlling for mean levels of positive and negative affect. In Study 3, we replicate these findings in a daily diary design, with the two conceptually related main symptoms of depression, sadness, and anhedonia, as specific manifestations of high NA and low PA, respectively. Across studies, additional analyses indicate these results are robust across different time scales and various PA and NA operationalizations and that affective bipolarity shows particular specificity toward depressive symptomatology, in comparison with anxiety symptoms. Together, these findings demonstrate that depressive symptoms involve stronger bipolarity between positive and negative affect, reflecting reduced emotional complexity and flexibility.},

This study reports a comprehensive multilevel meta-analysis on the effectiveness of progress feedback in psychological treatments in curative care. The short- and long-term effects of feedback on symptom reduction were investigated using 58 (randomized and non-randomized) studies, analyzing 110 effect sizes in a total of 21,699 patients. Effects of feedback on dropout rate, percentage of deteriorated cases, and treatment duration were also examined. Moderation analyses were conducted for study and feedback characteristics. A small significant effect of progress feedback on symptom reduction (d~=~0.15, 95\% CI: [0.10, 0.20]) was found, compared to control groups. This was also true for not-on-track cases (d~=~0.17, 95\% CI: [0.11, 0.22]). In addition, feedback had a small favorable effect on dropout rates (OR~=~1.19, 95\% CI: [1.03, 1.38]). The moderation analyses identified several potentially interesting variables for further research, including feedback instrument, outcome instrument, type of feedback, feedback frequency, treatment intensity, and country in which the study was conducted. Future studies should report on these variables more consistently so that we can obtain a better understanding of when and why feedback improves outcomes.},

We show that the Welch’s t-test provides a better control of Type 1 error rates when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not met, and it loses little robustness compared to Student’s t-test when the assumptions are met. We argue that Welch’s t-test should be used as a default strategy.},

  abstract = {Decisions made by researchers while analyzing data (e.g., how to measure variables, how to handle outliers) are sometimes arbitrary, without an objective justification for choosing one alternative over another. Multiverse-style methods (e.g., specification curve, vibration of effects) estimate an effect across an entire set of possible specifications to expose the impact of hidden degrees of freedom and/or obtain robust, less biased estimates of the effect of interest. However, if specifications are not truly arbitrary, multiverse-style analyses can produce misleading results, potentially hiding meaningful effects within a mass of poorly justified alternatives. So far, a key question has received scant attention: How does one decide whether alternatives are arbitrary? We offer a framework and conceptual tools for doing so. We discuss three kinds of a priori nonequivalence among alternatives—measurement nonequivalence, effect nonequivalence, and power/precision nonequivalence. The criteria we review lead to three decision scenarios: Type E decisions (principled equivalence), Type N decisions (principled nonequivalence), and Type U decisions (uncertainty). In uncertain scenarios, multiverse-style analysis should be conducted in a deliberately exploratory fashion. The framework is discussed with reference to published examples and illustrated with the help of a simulated data set. Our framework will help researchers reap the benefits of multiverse-style methods while avoiding their pitfalls.},

However, this approach does not take into account that these items are noisy indicators of the constructs they intend to measure. Structural equation modeling does take this into account. Several authors have concluded that it is impossible to make out-of-sample predictions based on a reflective structural equation model. We show that it is possible to make such predictions and we develop R-code to do so. With two empirical examples, we show that SEM-based prediction can outperform prediction based on linear regression models. With three simulation studies, we further investigate the SEM-based prediction rule and its robustness in comparison with predictions using regularized linear regression. We conclude that the new SEM-based prediction rule is robust against violation of the normality assumption but sensitive to model misspecification.},

In a large-scale experience sampling study in the Netherlands, we explored whether happiness differs by the type of natural environment experienced. We also investigated to what extent scenic beauty, peacefulness or fascinatingness are associated with momentary happiness. Smartphone apps were developed for both iOS and Android smartphones, and made freely available in both app stores. The app, named HappyHier, sent requests to fill in a short questionnaire, starting with how happy the participant feels. The requests were programmed to oversample experiences in natural environments. Location data were provided by the GPS of the smartphone, and the type of environment was determined based on a land-use map incorporated in the app. HappyHier was launched with a media campaign starting on 1st May 2016. In the following few months, over 4000 people participated, generating over 100,000 experience samples. Multi-level analyses were conducted, controlling for, among other things, being inside or outside, type of activity, type of company and weather conditions. The participants generally felt happier in natural environments, especially at the coast and in areas with low-lying natural vegetation, such as heathlands. Whether the environment is thought to be peaceful and fascinating appears to be more important for happiness than its scenic beauty. The representativeness of the data gathered by this relatively new method was explored from several angles: people, time and location.},

  abstract = {Background Actigraphy may provide a more valid assessment of sleep, circadian rhythm (CR), and physical activity (PA) than self‐reported questionnaires, but has not been used widely to study the association with depression/anxiety and their clinical characteristics. Methods Fourteen‐day actigraphy data of 359 participants with current (n\,=\,93), remitted (n\,=\,176), or no (n\,=\,90) composite international diagnostic interview depression/anxiety diagnoses were obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Objective estimates included sleep duration (SD), sleep efficiency, relative amplitude (RA) between day‐time and night‐time activity, mid sleep on free days (MSF), gross motor activity (GMA), and moderate‐to‐vigorous PA (MVPA). Self‐reported measures included insomnia rating scale, SD, MSF, metabolic equivalent total, and MVPA. Results Compared to controls, individuals with current depression/anxiety had a significantly different objective, but not self‐reported, PA and CR: lower GMA (23.83 vs. 27.4 milli‐gravity/day, p\,=\,.022), lower MVPA (35.32 vs. 47.64\,min/day, p\,=\,.023), lower RA (0.82 vs. 0.83, p\,=\,.033). In contrast, self‐reported, but not objective, sleep differed between people with current depression/anxiety compared to those without current disorders; people with current depression/anxiety reported both shorter and longer SD and more insomnia. More depressive/anxiety symptoms and number of depressive/anxiety diagnoses were associated with larger disturbances of the actigraphy measures. Conclusion Actigraphy provides ecologically valid information on sleep, CR, and PA that enhances data from self‐reported questionnaires. As those with more severe or comorbid forms showed the lowest PA and most CR disruptions, the potential for adjunctive behavioral and chronotherapy interventions should be explored, as well as the potential of actigraphy to monitor treatment response to such interventions.},

  abstract = {Background: Analyzing actigraphy data using standard circadian parametric models and aggregated nonparametric indices may obscure temporal information that may be a hallmark of the circadian impairment in psychiatric disorders. Functional data analysis (FDA) may overcome such limitations by fully exploiting the richness of actigraphy data and revealing important relationships with mental health outcomes. To our knowledge, no studies have extensively used FDA to study the relationship between sociodemographic, health and lifestyle, sampling, and psychiatric clinical characteristics and daily motor activity patterns assessed with actigraphy in a sample of individuals with and without depression/anxiety. Objective: We aimed to study the association between daily motor activity patterns assessed via actigraphy and (1) sociodemographic, health and lifestyle, and sampling factors, and (2) psychiatric clinical characteristics (ie, presence and severity of depression/anxiety disorders). Methods: We obtained 14-day continuous actigraphy data from 359 participants from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety with current (n=93), remitted (n=176), or no (n=90) depression/anxiety diagnosis, based on the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. Associations between patterns of daily motor activity, quantified via functional principal component analysis (fPCA), and sociodemographic, health and lifestyle, sampling, and psychiatric clinical characteristics were assessed using generalized estimating equation regressions. For exploratory purposes, function-on-scalar regression (FoSR) was applied to quantify the time-varying association of sociodemographic, health and lifestyle, sampling, and psychiatric clinical characteristics on daily motor activity. Results: Four components of daily activity patterns captured 77.4\% of the variability in the data: overall daily activity level (fPCA1, 34.3\% variability), early versus late morning activity (fPCA2, 16.5\% variability), biphasic versus monophasic activity (fPCA3, 14.8\% variability), and early versus late biphasic activity (fPCA4, 11.8\% variability). A low overall daily activity level was associated with a number of sociodemographic, health and lifestyle, and psychopathology variables: older age (P\&lt;.001), higher education level (P=.005), higher BMI (P=.009), greater number of chronic diseases (P=.02), greater number of cigarettes smoked per day (P=.02), current depressive and/or anxiety disorders (P=.05), and greater severity of depressive symptoms (P\&lt;.001). A high overall daily activity level was associated with work/school days (P=.02) and summer (reference: winter; P=.03). Earlier morning activity was associated with older age (P=.02), having a partner (P=.009), work/school days (P\&lt;.001), and autumn and spring (reference: winter; P=.02 and P\&lt;.001, respectively). Monophasic activity was associated with older age (P=.005). Biphasic activity was associated with work/school days (P\&lt;.001) and summer (reference: winter; P\&lt;.001). Earlier biphasic activity was associated with older age (P=.005), work/school days (P\&lt;.001), and spring and summer (reference: winter; P\&lt;.001 and P=.005, respectively). In FoSR analyses, age, work/school days, and season were the main determinants having a time-varying association with daily motor activity (all P\&lt;.05). Conclusions: Features of daily motor activity extracted with fPCA reflect commonly studied factors such as the intensity of daily activity and preference for morningness/eveningness. The presence and severity of depression/anxiety disorders were found to be associated mainly with a lower overall activity pattern but not with the time of the activity. Age, work/school days, and season were the variables most strongly associated with patterns and time of activity, and thus future epidemiological studies on motor activity in depression/anxiety should take these variables into account.},

  abstract = {Background: Electronic mental health interventions for mood disorders have increased rapidly over the past decade, most recently in the form of various systems and apps that are delivered via smartphones. Objective: We aim to provide an overview of studies on smartphone-based systems that combine subjective ratings with objectively measured data for longitudinal monitoring of patients with affective disorders. Specifically, we aim to examine current knowledge on: (1) the feasibility of, and adherence to, such systems; (2) the association of monitored data with mood status; and (3) the effects of monitoring on clinical outcomes. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant articles published in the last ten years (2007-2017) by applying Boolean search operators with an iterative combination of search terms, which was conducted in February 2017. Additional articles were identified via pearling, author correspondence, selected reference lists, and trial protocols. Results: A total of 3463 unique records were identified. Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The majority of articles represented feasibility studies (n=27); two articles reported results from one randomized controlled trial (RCT). In total, six different self-monitoring systems for affective disorders that used subjective mood ratings and objective measurements were included. These objective parameters included physiological data (heart rate variability), behavioral data (phone usage, physical activity, voice features), and context/environmental information (light exposure and location). The included articles contained results regarding feasibility of such systems in affective disorders, showed reasonable accuracy in predicting mood status and mood fluctuations based on the objectively monitored data, and reported observations about the impact of monitoring on clinical state and adherence of patients to the system usage. Conclusions: The included observational studies and RCT substantiate the value of smartphone-based approaches for gathering long-term objective data (aside from self-ratings to monitor clinical symptoms) to predict changes in clinical states, and to investigate causal inferences about state changes in patients with affective disorders. Although promising, a much larger evidence-base is necessary to fully assess the potential and the risks of these approaches. Methodological limitations of the available studies (eg, small sample sizes, variations in the number of observations or monitoring duration, lack of RCT, and heterogeneity of methods) restrict the interpretability of the results. However, a number of study protocols stated ambitions to expand and intensify research in this emerging and promising field.  [J Med Internet Res 2017;19(7):e262]},

  abstract = {A wide range of machine-learning-based approaches have been developed in the past decade, increasing our ability to accurately model nonlinear and nonadditive response surfaces. This has improved performance for inferential tasks such as estimating average treatment effects in situations where standard parametric models may not fit the data well. These methods have also shown promise for the related task of identifying heterogeneous treatment effects. However, the estimation of both overall and heterogeneous treatment effects can be hampered when data are structured within groups if we fail to correctly model the dependence between observations. Most machine learning methods do not readily accommodate such structure. This paper introduces a new algorithm, stan4bart, that combines the flexibility of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for fitting nonlinear response surfaces with the computational and statistical efficiencies of using Stan for the parametric components of the model. We demonstrate how stan4bart can be used to estimate average, subgroup, and individual-level treatment effects with stronger performance than other flexible approaches that ignore the multilevel structure of the data as well as multilevel approaches that have strict parametric forms.},

  abstract = {In ecology, the true causal structure for a given problem is often not known, and several plausible models and thus model predictions exist. It has been claimed that using weighted averages of these models can reduce prediction error, as well as better reflect model selection uncertainty. These claims, however, are often demonstrated by isolated examples. Analysts must better understand under which conditions model averaging can improve predictions and their uncertainty estimates. Moreover, a large range of different model averaging methods exists, raising the question of how they differ in their behaviour and performance. Here, we review the mathematical foundations of model averaging along with the diversity of approaches available. We explain that the error in model-averaged predictions depends on each model's predictive bias and variance, as well as the covariance in predictions between models, and uncertainty about model weights. We show that model averaging is particularly useful if the predictive error of contributing model predictions is dominated by variance, and if the covariance between models is low. For noisy data, which predominate in ecology, these conditions will often be met. Many different methods to derive averaging weights exist, from Bayesian over information-theoretical to cross-validation optimized and resampling approaches. A general recommendation is difficult, because the performance of methods is often context dependent. Importantly, estimating weights creates some additional uncertainty. As a result, estimated model weights may not always outperform arbitrary fixed weights, such as equal weights for all models. When averaging a set of models with many inadequate models, however, estimating model weights will typically be superior to equal weights. We also investigate the quality of the confidence intervals calculated for model-averaged predictions, showing that they differ greatly in behaviour and seldom manage to achieve nominal coverage. Our overall recommendations stress the importance of non-parametric methods such as cross-validation for a reliable uncertainty quantification of model-averaged predictions.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the German versions of the IDS-SR and IDS-C in comparison to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The sample consisted of 59 inpatients and outpatients treated for unipolar or bipolar disorders. Internal consistency of the IDS-SR and IDS-C was found highly acceptable (α = 0.94 and α = 0.93). Item-total-correlations of the IDS-SR revealed that 68\% of the items were strongly correlated with the sum score (≥0.50). This was in the same range with the IDS-C (54\%), the HRSD (53\%) and the BDI (76\%). Furthermore, there is a high concurrent validity (r ≥ 0.88) of the IDS-SR with the IDS-C, the BDI and the HRSD. Substantial score-differences between inpatients and outpatients indicate a good discriminant validity. It is concluded that the German version of the IDS is a useful instrument for the assessment of depressive symptoms and that it has the same highly acceptable psychometric properties as the original English version.

  abstract = {Continuous time dynamic models are similar to popular discrete time models such as autoregressive cross-lagged models, but through use of stochastic differential equations can accurately account for differences in time intervals between measurements, and more parsimoniously specify complex dynamics. As such they offer powerful and flexible approaches to understand ongoing psychological processes and interventions, and allow for measurements to be taken a variable number of times, and at irregular intervals. However, limited developments have taken place regarding the use of continuous time models in a fully hierarchical context, in which all model parameters are allowed to vary over individuals. This has meant that questions regarding individual differences in parameters have had to rely on single-subject time series approaches, which require far more measurement occasions per individual. We present a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimating continuous time dynamic models, allowing for individual variation in all model parameters. We also describe an extension to the ctsem package for R, which interfaces to the Stan software and allows simple specification and fitting of such models. To demonstrate the approach, we use a subsample from the German socioeconomic panel and relate overall life satisfaction and satisfaction with health.},

I describe problems in the interpretation of cross-effects when processes that are thought to fluctuate continuously in time are, as is typically done, modeled as changing only in discrete steps (as in e.g. structural equation modelling) – zeroes in a discrete-time temporal matrix do not necessarily correspond to zeroe effects in the underlying continuous processes, and vice versa. This has implications for the common case when the presence or absence of cross-effects is used for inference about underlying causal processes. I demonstrate these problems via simulation, and also show that when an underlying set of processes are continuous in time, even relatively few direct causal links can result in much denser temporal effect matrices in discrete-time. I demonstrate one solution to these issues, namely parameterizing the system as a stochastic differential equation and focusing inference on the continuous-time temporal effects. I follow this with some discussion of issues regarding the switch to continuous-time, specifically regularization, appropriate measurement time lag, and model order.},

  abstract = {Background Adverse family experiences in early life are associated with subsequent psychopathology. This study adds to the growing body of work exploring the nature and associations between adverse experiences over the childhood years. Methods Primary carers of 1143 randomly recruited 14-year olds in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, UK were interviewed using the Cambridge Early Experiences Interview (CAMEEI) to assess family-focused adversities. Adversities were recorded retrospectively in three time periods (early and later childhood and early adolescence). Latent Class Analysis (LCA) grouped individuals into adversity classes for each time period and longitudinally. Adolescents were interviewed to generate lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses using the K-SADS-PL. The associations between adversity class and diagnoses were explored. Results LCA generated a 4-class model for each time period and longitudinally. In early childhood 69\% were allocated to a low adversity class; a moderate adversity class (19\%) showed elevated rates of family loss, mild or moderate family discord, financial difficulties, maternal psychiatric illness and higher risk for paternal atypical parenting; a severe class (6\%) experienced higher rates on all indicators and almost exclusively accounted for incidents of child abuse; a fourth class, characterised by atypical parenting from both parents, accounted for the remaining 7\%. Class membership was fairly stable (\textasciitilde{} 55\%) over time with escape from any adversity by 14 years being uncommon. Compared to those in the low class, the odds ratio for reported psychopathology in adolescents in the severe class ranged from 8 for disruptive behaviour disorders through to 4.8 for depressions and 2.0 for anxiety disorders. Only in the low adversity class did significantly more females than males report psychopathology. Conclusions Family adversities in the early years occur as multiple rather than single experiences. Although some children escape adversity, for many this negative family environment persists over the first 15 years of life. Different profiles of family risk may be associated with specific mental disorders in young people. Sex differences in psychopathologies may be most pronounced in those exposed to low levels of family adversities.},

In order to compare these constructs across groups, one crucial requirement is that they are measured equivalently or, in technical jargon, that measurement invariance (MI) holds across the groups. This study compared the performance of scale- and item-level approaches based on multiple group categorical confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CCFA) and multiple group item response theory (MG-IRT) in testing MI with ordinal data. In general, the results of the simulation studies showed that MG-CCFA-based approaches outperformed MG-IRT-based approaches when testing MI at the scale level, whereas, at the item level, the best performing approach depends on the tested parameter (i.e., loadings or thresholds). That is, when testing loadings equivalence, the likelihood ratio test provided the best trade-off between true-positive rate and false-positive rate, whereas, when testing thresholds equivalence, the χ2 test outperformed the other testing strategies. In addition, the performance of MG-CCFA’s fit measures, such as RMSEA and CFI, seemed to depend largely on the length of the scale, especially when MI was tested at the item level. General caution is recommended when using these measures, especially when MI is tested for each item individually.},

This large-scale preregistered intensive longitudinal study conducted 68 240 observations of 1706 individuals in the general adult population across a 40-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the detrimental processes involved in depressive states. Daily responses were modeled using multi-level dynamic network analysis to investigate temporal associations across days, in addition to contemporaneous relationships between depressive components within a daily window. Among the investigated psychopathological mechanisms, helplessness predicted the strongest across-day influence on depressive symptoms, while emotion regulation difficulties displayed more proximal interactions with symptomatology. Helplessness was further involved in the amplification of other theorized psychopathological mechanisms including rumination, the latter of which to a greater extent was susceptible toward being influenced rather than temporally influencing other components involved in depressive states. Distinctive symptoms of depression behaved differently, with depressed mood and anhedonia most prone to being impacted, while lethargy and worthlessness were more strongly associated with outgoing activity in the network. These results have implications for the impediment of detrimental depressive symptomatology during the present pandemic and beyond the pandemic period.},

  abstract = {Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous mental disorder. International guidelines present overall symptom severity as the key dimension for clinical characterisation. However, additional layers of individual differences may reside within severity levels related to differences in how symptoms interact with one-another in a given patient, referred to as symptom dynamics. We investigate these individual differences by estimating the proportion of patients that display differences in their symptom relationship patterns while sharing the same overall symptom severity. Methods Patients with MDD recruited at four centres in the Netherlands between 2016-2018 rated their baseline symptom severity using the Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR). Momentary indicators for symptoms were collected through Ecological Momentary Assessments scheduled to measure each patient five times per day for 28 days. Each patient’s symptom dynamics were estimated using dynamic networks based on the graphical vector autoregressive model. Individual differences in these symptom relationship patterns in groups of patients sharing the same symptom severity levels were estimated using Individual Network Invariance Tests, before the overall proportion of patients that displayed differential symptom dynamics while sharing the same symptom severity was calculated. To compute 95\% bootstrapped confidence intervals around this proportion, 10,000 re-estimations following random draws with replacement of the symptom severity groups were performed. A supplementary simulation study was conducted to investigate the accuracy of our methodology by identifying its average false positive detection rate in a simulated scenario where no individual differences should be present. Results Out of 74 patients, 73 were analysed (Mage = 34.57 [SD 13.12]; 56.16\% females; 63.01\% employed) and 8,395 observations were conducted across the 28-day period (average completed assessments per person: 115; SD 16.81). 23 severity levels (IDS-SR values) were observed in the sample, enabling the investigation of individual differences in 23 groups of MDD patients (between 2 to 6 patients per group) sharing the same severity. Differential symptom dynamics were identified across 63.01\% (95\% bootstrapped CI 40.98, 82.05) of patients displaying the same severity. The simulation study revealed our method’s average false detection of individual differences in our scenario to be 2.22\%. Conclusions The majority of MDD patients sharing the same symptom severity displayed differential symptom dynamics. Our findings were robust against false positive conclusions. Examining symptom dynamics provides information about the person-specific psychopathological expression of patients beyond severity levels by revealing how symptoms aggravate each other over time. These results suggest that symptom dynamics may serve as a promising dimension for clinical characterisation, warranting replication in independent samples. To inform personalised treatment planning, a next step concerns linking different symptom relationship patterns to treatment response and clinical course, including patterns related to spontaneous recovery and forms of disorder progression.},

  abstract = {This study examined the relationship between time of day, day of the week, and two measures of positive affect (PA). According to previous research and the circumplex model of affect, one scale was designed to assess the activation component of PA, and the other one measured the pleasantness aspect. Subjects rated their mood three times a day for 7 consecutive days. Consistent with our hypotheses, PA-Pleasantness showed a peak on the weekend, whereas PA-Activation remained stable throughout the week. Regarding time of day, maximum PA-Activation was reached in the afternoon. In contrast, the Pleasantness component of PA increased from morning to evening. Implications of these results as well as other findings concerning the differential content of “PA” measures are discussed regarding the fact that a certain scale is most appropriate and maximally valid for representing certain aspects of affective experience.},

Preregistered multilevel regression analyses and analyses of variance were used to analyze the effect of design condition on momentary outcomes, changes in those outcomes over time, and retrospective outcomes. Our findings offer support for increased burden and compromised data quantity and quality with longer questionnaires, but not with increased sampling frequency.

Although social interactions are an important aspect of individuals’ social lives, little is known about how depressive symptoms affect behavioral patterns in social interaction networks. This article analyzes the effect of depressive symptoms on social interactions in two empirical settings (Ntotal\,=\,123, Ndyadic relations\,=\,2,454) of students spending a weekend together in a remote camp house. We measured social interactions between participants with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) nametags. Prior to the weekend, participants were surveyed on their depressive symptoms and friendship ties. Using state-of-the-art social network analysis methods, we test four preregistered hypotheses. Our results indicate that depressive symptoms are associated with (1) spending less time in social interaction, (2) spending time with similarly depressed others, (3) spending time in pair-wise interactions rather than group interactions but not with (4) spending relatively less time with friends. By “zooming in” on face-to-face social interaction networks, these findings offer new insights into the social consequences of depressive symptoms.},

  abstract = {Social isolation and depression are tightly linked and can reinforce each other in a vicious cycle. Yet, the antecedents of this complex cycle are not well understood. To date, little is known about how the dynamics of social isolation in daily life (i.e., solitude) play a role in this cycle. To investigate these complex dynamics, we introduce the concept of solitude inertia, which captures individuals' tendencies to remain in social states of solitude. We argue that, although short-term solitude can have both positive and negative effects on individuals' depressive symptoms, prolonged states of solitude (i.e., high solitude inertia) are detrimental. At the same time, individuals with depression might be more vulnerable to "get stuck" in solitude. In this study, we tease apart the bidirectional relationship between solitude inertia and depressive symptoms. We use data from the MindMaastricht study in which 129 individuals with residual depressive symptoms participated in two experience sampling assessments phases (T1 and T2) that were 8 weeks apart (Nobs = 11,558). Using logistic multilevel models, we find that higher levels of depressive symptoms are related to higher solitude inertia. We further show that depressive symptoms at T1 are not predictive of solitude inertia at T2. However, solitude inertia at T1 was predictive of depressive symptoms eight weeks later (T2) in a linear regression analysis. This study introduces and highlights the role of solitude inertia as a potential intervention target in social isolation and depression dynamics.

  abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize behavior as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various research fields. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

These network models often contain significant numbers of unknown parameters, yet the sample sizes available in psychological research are limited. As such, general assumptions about the true network are introduced to reduce the number of free parameters. Incorporating these assumptions, however, means that the resulting network will lead to reflect the particular structure assumed by the estimation method—a crucial and often ignored aspect of psychopathological networks. For example, observing a sparse structure and simultaneously assuming a sparse structure does not imply that the true model is, in fact, sparse. To illustrate this point, we discuss recent literature and show the effect of the assumption of sparsity in three simulation studies.},

Two networks can be computed: a temporal network, in which one investigates if symptoms (or other relevant variables) predict one another over time, and a contemporaneous network, in which one investigates if symptoms predict one another in the same window of measurement. The contemporaneous network is a partial correlation network, which is emerging in the analysis of cross-sectional data but is not yet utilized in the analysis of time series data. We explain the importance of partial correlation networks and exemplify the network structures on time series data of a psychiatric patient.},

This assumes that all variables are measured without measurement error, which may be implausible. In addition, cross-sectional data cannot distinguish between within-subject and between-subject effects. This paper provides a general framework that extends GGM modeling with latent variables, including relationships over time. These relationships can be estimated from time-series data or panel data featuring at least three waves of measurement. The model takes the form of a graphical vector-autoregression model between latent variables and is termed the ts-lvgvar when estimated from time-series data and the panel-lvgvar when estimated from panel data. These methods have been implemented in the software package psychonetrics, which is exemplified in two empirical examples, one using time-series data and one using panel data, and evaluated in two large-scale simulation studies. The paper concludes with a discussion on ergodicity and generalizability. Although within-subject effects may in principle be separated from between-subject effects, the interpretation of these results rests on the intensity and the time interval of measurement and on the plausibility of the assumption of stationarity.},

  abstract = {We present the qgraph package for R, which provides an interface to visualize data through network modeling techniques. For instance, a correlation matrix can be represented as a network in which each variable is a node and each correlation an edge; by varying the width of the edges according to the magnitude of the correlation, the structure of the correlation matrix can be visualized. A wide variety of matrices that are used in statistics can be represented in this fashion, for example matrices that contain (implied) covariances, factor loadings, regression parameters and p values. qgraph can also be used as a psychometric tool, as it performs exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, using sem and lavaan; the output of these packages is automatically visualized in qgraph, which may aid the interpretation of results. In this article, we introduce qgraph by applying the package functions to data from the NEO-PI-R, a widely used personality questionnaire.},

In this framework, psychological variables are understood to directly affect each other rather than being caused by an unobserved latent entity. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to estimating the most popular network model for psychological data: the partial correlation network. We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure in psychological data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on posttraumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the effect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to determine the required sample size for a network analysis, and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems that can arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.},

  abstract = {Across different fields of research, the similarities and differences between various longitudinal models are not always eminently clear due to differences in data structure, application area, and terminology. Here we propose a comprehensive model framework that will allow simple comparisons between longitudinal models, to ease their empirical application and interpretation. At the within-individual level, our model framework accounts for various attributes of longitudinal data, such as growth and decline, cyclical trends, and the dynamic interplay between variables over time. At the between-individual level, our framework contains continuous and categorical latent variables to account for between-individual differences. This framework encompasses several well-known longitudinal models, including multilevel regression models, growth curve models, growth mixture models, vector-autoregressive models, and multilevel vector-autoregressive models. The general model framework is specified and its key characteristics are illustrated using famous longitudinal models as concrete examples. Various longitudinal models are reviewed and it is shown that all these models can be united into our comprehensive model framework. Extensions to the model framework are discussed. Recommendations for selecting and specifying longitudinal models are made for empirical researchers who aim to account for between-individual differences.

  abstract = {Studying emotion dynamics through time series models is becoming increasingly popular in the social sciences. Across individuals, dynamics can be rather heterogeneous. To enable comparisons and generalizations of dynamics across groups of individuals, one needs sophisticated tools that express the essential similarities and differences. A way to proceed is to identify subgroups of people who are characterized by qualitatively similar emotion dynamics through dynamic clustering. So far, these methods assume equal generating processes for individuals per cluster. To avoid this overly restrictive assumption, we outline a probabilistic clustering approach based on a mixture model that clusters on individuals? vector autoregressive coefficients. We evaluate the performance of the method and compare it with a nonprobabilistic method in a simulation study. The usefulness of the methods is illustrated using 366 ecological momentary assessment time series with external measures of depression and anxiety.},

Nevertheless, measurements of attributes such as emotions or intelligence continue to be widely used in research and society.

Based on this, I argue that psychological measurement is fundamentally different from measurement in the physical sciences but can nevertheless be useful.},

The decision procedure involves a comparison between a posterior highest density interval (HDI) and a pre-specified region of practical equivalence (ROPE). One then accepts or rejects the null parameter value depending on the overlap (or lack thereof) between these intervals. Here we demonstrate, both theoretically and through examples, that this procedure is logically incoherent. Because the HDI is not transformation invariant, the ultimate inferential decision depends on statistically arbitrary and scientifically irrelevant properties of the statistical model. The incoherence arises from a common confusion between probability density and probability proper.  The HDI+ROPE procedure relies on characterizing posterior densities as opposed to being based directly on probability. We conclude with recommendations for alternative Bayesian testing procedures that do not exhibit this pathology and provide a "quick fix" in the form of quantile intervals.},

However, most of these studies have cross-sectional designs and use self-report indicators of SNS use. Therefore, their conclusions should be interpreted cautiously. Consequently, the goal of the current experience sampling study was to examine the temporal dynamics between objective indicators of SNS use, and self-reports of social comparison, RNT, and daily fluctuations in negative affect. More specifically, we assessed 98 participants 6 times per day during 14 days to examine reciprocal relationships between SNS use, negative affect, emotion regulation, and key psychological constructs. Results indicate that (1) both Facebook and Instagram use predicted reduced well-being, and (2) self-esteem and RNT appear to be important intermediate constructs in these relationships. Future longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to further support and extend the current research findings.},

Studies measuring differences in psychomotor activity between unipolar and bipolar disorder show divergent results and none have used a combined heart rate and movement monitor for measuring activity during free-living conditions. Objective To compare objectively measured psychomotor activity in patients with unipolar and bipolar disorder in a remitted or mild/moderate depressive state. Further, both groups were compared to a healthy control group. Methods A cross-sectional study of outpatients suffering from unipolar (n=20) and bipolar (n=18) disorder and healthy controls (n=31), aged 18–60years. For three consecutive days a combined acceleration (m/s2) and heart rate (beats per minute) monitoring was used in conjunction with a step test to estimate activity energy expenditure (J/min/kg) as measures of psychomotor activity and physical fitness. Results Overall score on Hamilton-17 items ranged between 0 and 22. Patients had higher sleeping heart rate (p{$<$}0.001), lower fitness (p=0.02), lower acceleration (p=0.004), and lower activity energy expenditure (p=0.004) compared to controls. Comparing unipolar and bipolar patients and adjusting for differences in Hamilton-17 revealed lower acceleration (p=0.01) and activity energy expenditure in bipolar patients (p=0.02); the difference was most prominent in the morning. Conclusions Electronic monitoring of psychomotor activity may be a promising additional tool in the distinction between unipolar and bipolar affective disorder when patients present in a remitted or depressive state.},

Psychiatry has not yet benefited from the advanced diagnostic and therapeutic technologies that form an integral part of other clinical specialties. Thus, the vision of precision medicine as applied to psychiatry – ‘precision psychiatry’ – promises to be even more transformative than in other fields of medicine, which have already lessened the translational gap. Discussion Herein, we describe ‘precision psychiatry’ and how its several implications promise to transform the psychiatric landscape. We pay particular attention to biomarkers and to how the development of new technologies now makes their discovery possible and timely. The adoption of the term ‘precision psychiatry’ will help propel the field, since the current term ‘precision medicine’, as applied to psychiatry, is impractical and does not appropriately distinguish the field. Naming the field ‘precision psychiatry’ will help establish a stronger, unique identity to what promises to be the most important area in psychiatry in years to come. Conclusion In summary, we provide a wide-angle lens overview of what this new field is, suggest how to propel the field forward, and provide a vision of the near future, with ‘precision psychiatry’ representing a paradigm shift that promises to change the landscape of how psychiatry is currently conceived.},

  abstract = {In item response theory, uncertainty associated with estimated item parameters can lead to greater uncertainty in subsequent analyses, such as estimating trait scores for individual examinees. Most existing methods to characterize or correct for item parameter uncertainty implicitly assume that the latent trait continuum is fixed across the posterior distribution of item parameters. However, the latent trait continuum can also be understood as an artifact of the fitted model, such that the location of this continuum is determined with error. In other words, item parameter estimation error implies uncertainty about the location of the metric. This article uses Ramsay’s (1996) geometry of the latent trait metric to develop a quantitative measure of metric stability, that is, the sampling variability of the latent trait continuum implied by errors in item parameter estimation. Through a series of illustrations, it is clarified how metric stability is related to other item response model evaluation outcomes (e.g., test information, model fit), and how metric stability can be useful in identifying well-determined regions of the latent trait continuum, making sample size recommendations, and selecting a model. Overall, the proposed measure of metric stability provides meaningful and highly interpretable information to aid in item response model evaluation.},

  abstract = {Only for ergodic processes will inferences based on group-level data generalize to individual experience or behavior. Because human social and psychological processes typically have an individually variable and time-varying nature, they are unlikely to be ergodic. In this paper, six studies with a repeated-measure design were used for symmetric comparisons of interindividual and intraindividual variation. Our results delineate the potential scope and impact of nonergodic data in human subjects research. Analyses across six samples (with 87–94 participants and an equal number of assessments per participant) showed some degree of agreement in central tendency estimates (mean) between groups and individuals across constructs and data collection paradigms. However, the variance around the expected value was two to four times larger within individuals than within groups. This suggests that literatures in social and medical sciences may overestimate the accuracy of aggregated statistical estimates. This observation could have serious consequences for how we understand the consistency between group and individual correlations, and the generalizability of conclusions between domains. Researchers should explicitly test for equivalence of processes at the individual and group level across the social and medical sciences.},

  abstract = {Psychosocial treatments for mood and anxiety disorders are generally effective, however, a number of treated individuals fail to demonstrate clinically-significant change. Consistent with the decades-old aim to identify ‘what works for whom,’ personalized and precision treatments have become a recent area of interest in medicine and psychology. The present study followed the recommendations of Fisher (2015) to employ a personalized modular model of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Employing the algorithms provided by Fernandez, Fisher, and Chi (2017), the present study collected intensive repeated measures data prior to therapy in order to perform person-specific factor analysis and dynamic factor modeling. The results of these analyses were then used to generated personalized modular treatment plans on a person-by-person basis. Thirty-two participants completed therapy. The average number of sessions was 10.38. Hedges g's for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) were 2.33 and 1.62, respectively. The change per unit time was g = .24/session for the HRSD and g\,=\,0.17/session for the HARS. The current open trial provides promising data in support of personalization, modularization, and idiographic research paradigms.},

Despite the many benefits these data provide, little work has been dedicated to realize the potential such data hold for forecasting dynamic processes at the individual level. To address this gap in the literature, we present the multi-VAR framework, a novel methodological approach allowing for penalized estimation of ILD collected from multiple individuals. Importantly, our approach estimates models for all individuals simultaneously and is capable of adaptively adjusting to the amount of heterogeneity present across individual dynamic processes. To accomplish this, we propose a novel proximal gradient descent algorithm for solving the multi-VAR problem and prove the consistency of the recovered transition matrices. We evaluate the forecasting performance of our method in comparison with a number of benchmark methods and provide an illustrative example involving the day-to-day emotional experiences of 16 individuals over an 11-week period.},

This is also the case for researchers looking to characterize the impact of an intervention on individual behavior. To be useful, statistical models must be capable of characterizing these processes as complex, time-dependent phenomenon, otherwise only a fraction of the system dynamics will be recovered. In this paper we introduce a Square-Root Second-Order Extended Kalman Filtering approach for estimating smoothly time-varying parameters. This approach is capable of handling dynamic factor models where the relations between variables underlying the processes of interest change in a manner that may be difficult to specify in advance. We examine the performance of our approach in a Monte Carlo simulation and show the proposed algorithm accurately recovers the unobserved states in the case of a bivariate dynamic factor model with time-varying dynamics and treatment effects. Furthermore, we illustrate the utility of our approach in characterizing the time-varying effect of a meditation intervention on day-to-day emotional experiences.},

This approach differs from many popular modeling approaches for multiple-subject time series in that qualitative and quantitative differences in a large number of individual dynamics are well-accommodated. The current work extends the multi-VAR framework to include new adaptive weighting schemes that greatly improve estimation performance. In a small set of simulation studies we compare adaptive multi-VAR with these new penalty weights to common alternative estimators in terms of path recovery and bias. Furthermore, we provide toy examples and code demonstrating the utility of multi-VAR under different heterogeneity regimes using the multivar package for R (Fisher et al., 2021).},

Doubts arise for a host of reasons, including a lack of transparency, ignorance, negligence, or misrepresentation of the evidence. We describe the scope of the problem and focus on how transparency is a part of the solution. A lack of measurement transparency makes it impossible to evaluate potential threats to internal, external, statistical-conclusion, and construct validity. We demonstrate that psychology is plagued by a measurement schmeasurement attitude: QMPs are common, hide a stunning source of researcher degrees of freedom, and pose a serious threat to cumulative psychological science, but are largely ignored. We address these challenges by providing a set of questions that researchers and consumers of scientific research can consider to identify and avoid QMPs. Transparent answers to these measurement questions promote rigorous research, allow for thorough evaluations of a study’s inferences, and are necessary for meaningful replication studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: No study has investigated the role of inflammation in explaining the association between early exposures to adverse life events and depressive symptoms in adolescence. METHOD: Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we tested if inflammatory markers [serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6)] at age 9 years mediate the association between adverse life events, measured separately for the prenatal (since the beginning of pregnancy) and the childhood (ages 0-9 years) periods, and the development of depressive symptoms at ages 10-17 years. Data (n\,=\,4,263) were analyzed using mediation analysis in a latent growth curve modeling framework. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms at the beginning of adolescence (age 10) were associated with the number of prenatal events, the number of events around birth and the increase in events over time in childhood (ages 0-9), even after adjustment for confounders. IL-6 partially mediated the association between increasing exposure to events over time in childhood and depressive symptoms at the beginning of adolescence. IL-6 did not mediate any other association between events and symptoms. There was no evidence for mediation by CRP, which was generally unrelated to exposure to events. LIMITATIONS: The small size of the mediation effect and the robust direct effects of events prenatally and around birth suggest there are multiple routes from early stressors to adolescent depression. CONCLUSIONS: In the general adolescent population, increasing exposure to psychosocial stressors over time during childhood is associated with the early onset of depressive symptoms, partly via increasing levels of plasma IL-6.},

This has led to the formulation of the so-called “Dodo bird verdict”, based on the Alice in Wonderland story, which argues that “all [psychotherapies] have won and all must have prizes”. Consequently, major figures in the field have questioned the notion that theory-specific techniques or interventions, such as addressing dysfunctional cognitions in cognitive-behavioral therapy, or the relationship between past and present in psychodynamic therapy, are mainly responsible for therapeutic outcome. They argue that, instead, factors that are common to effective treatments – providing the patient with hope and with a comprehensive theory that explains the patient’s complaints – would typically explain a greater proportion of the therapeutic outcome. This would be particularly the case if the therapist is able to establish a warm and empathic therapeutic relationship with the patient. Hence, the “Dodo bird” still looms unresolved over the field of psychotherapy (Budd \& Hughes, 2009; Mansell, 2011). In this paper, I will attempt to set out a new, evolutionarily informed approach to the “Dodo bird” controversy, which we speculate may have implications for understanding psychopathology more generally.},

In this paper – the first of two parts – we review evidence suggesting that a general psychopathology or p factor underlies vulnerability for psychopathology. We link this p factor to a lack of resilience using Kalisch and colleagues’ positive appraisal style theory of resilience (PASTOR). We argue that vulnerability for (severe) psychopathology results from impairments in three central mechanisms underlying resilience – positive situation classification, retrospective reappraisal of threat, and inhibition of retraumatizing triggers – which in turn result from a lack of flexibility in terms of social communicative processes. We suggest that, from this perspective, personality disorders, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) in particular, can be considered to be the prototype of disorders characterized by a lack of resilience. Part 2 proposes an evolutionary developmental psychopathology account linking this inflexibility in social communication to problems with the development of epistemic trust – that is, an evolutionary pre-wired social communication system that normally facilitates resilience through salutogenesis, that is, the capacity to learn and derive benefit from the (social) environment.},

Bayesian posterior predictive distributions, p(y | x), characterize subjective beliefs on outcomes of interest, y, conditional on predictors, x. Bayesian prediction is well-calibrated when the model is true, but the predictive intervals may exhibit poor empirical coverage when the model is misspecified, under the so called M-open perspective. In contrast, conformal inference provides finite sample frequentist guarantees on predictive confidence intervals without the requirement of model fidelity. Using ‘add-one-in’ importance sampling, we show that conformal Bayesian predictive intervals are efficiently obtained from re-weighted posterior samples of model parameters. Our approach contrasts with existing conformal methods that require expensive refitting of models or data-splitting to achieve computational efficiency. We demonstrate the utility on a range of examples including extensions to partially exchangeable settings such as hierarchical models.},

The third aim is to show how joint modeling can be used for validity research. A simulation study was used to examine the second aim, while an empirical example was used to illustrate the third aim. The simulation study used three data generating processes, with varying degrees of deviation from linear models and with different sample sizes. Results of the simulation study showed that the Bayesian implementation supersedes the other models. In the empirical example, data collected from 66 participants using an iterated prisoner dilemma and a scale measuring cooperation-competition attitudes were used. Results showed that joint modeling is the best fitting model, also increasing the correlation between the true scores of both measures (deviations from the iterated prisoner dilemma and the scale). Finally, implications, limitations and future studies are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The majority of individuals with depression experience sleep disturbances. Depression is also over-represented among populations with a variety of sleep disorders. Although sleep disturbances are typical features of depression, such symptoms sometimes appear prior to an episode of depression. The bidirectional associations between sleep disturbance (especially insomnia) and depression increase the difficulty of differentiating cause-and-effect relationships between them. Longitudinal studies have consistently identified insomnia as a risk factor for the development of a new-onset or recurrent depression, and this association has been identified in young, middle-aged, and older adults. Studies have also observed that the combination of insomnia and depression influences the trajectory of depression, increasing episode severity and duration as well as relapse rates. Fortunately, recent studies have demonstrated that both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for insomnia may favorably reduce and possibly prevent depression. Together, these findings suggest that sleep-related symptoms that are present before, during, andlor after a depressive episode are potentially modifiable factors that may play an important role in achieving and maintaining depression remission.},

  abstract = {Researchers have increasingly adopted complex methodological approaches to investigate the co-development of symptoms over longer time frames, such as months and years. Panel studies assess a large group of individuals at multiple time points over an extended period. Various analytical approaches exist for examining the co-development of variables in panel data, yet a comprehensive overview is lacking. This study provides a detailed review and application of four key analytical approaches for examining cross-lagged associations in panel data. The four approaches include two Structural Equation Models (SEM): the Cross- Lagged Panel Model (CLPM) and the Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI- CLPM), along with two network model adaptations: Cross-Lagged Panel Network analysis (CLPN) and Panel Graphical Vector Autoregression Model (GVAR). We describe each method’s distinct characteristics, advantages, and limitations. To illustrate these, we applied these models to a panel dataset of adolescents and young adults (NSPN 2400 cohort study), examining the relationships between impulsivity and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results showed varying temporal associations, highlighting the importance of model selection based on research objectives and data characteristics. A simulation study demonstrated that models separating within- and between-person effects (panel GVAR, RI- CLPM) reproduced true within-person temporal effects more accurately. Our review highlights the value of using multiple approaches in multiverse analyses to assess the sensitivity of findings to different analytical methods. Ultimately, the choice of analytical method greatly influences how dynamic cross-lagged processes in developmental psychopathology are interpreted, affecting the development and refinement of relevant clinical theories.},

  abstract = {Decades of research have established seasonality effects on completed and attempted suicides, with an increase in rates during spring and early summer. Using more than six years of data (April 2012 – November 2018), we used new Prophet models to forecast mood and explicit and implicit measures of self-harm among an online community sample residing in the US and UK (N {$>$} 7,975). We decomposed the time series into trends across the years, within years (seasons), weekly, and daily seasonal patterns. Across all outcomes, the long-term changes across the years and the seasonal patterns show the strongest variation on explicit and implicit cognitions, followed by the time of day (negative cognitions peaking around 4 am – 5 am), with the day of the week showing the weakest effects. The data show a general increase of negative cognitions across the six years, paralleling trends in suicide rates and depression prevalence in the US and UK. Autoregressive-integrated moving average (ARIMA) models showed seasonality effects for mood and desire to die among US, UK, and Canadian respondents (N {$>$} 10,445), particularly in the group of respondents who previously made a suicide attempt. Negative cognitions were generally the lowest in summer (June) and peaked in winter (December). These negative cognitions precede the rise in suicidal behaviors during spring and early summer. We discuss potential reasons for lagged effects of negative cognitions on suicidal behavior and implicit cognitions, which may be crucial for theoretical advancements. Our findings have implications for the clinical risk assessment of patients with a history of suicide attempts and public policies regarding the availability of health services.},

  abstract = {Background: Depression severity is assessed in numerous research disciplines, ranging from the social sciences to genetics, and used as a dependent variable, predictor, covariate, or to enroll participants. The routine practice is to assess depression severity with one particular depression scale, and draw conclusions about depression in general, relying on the assumption that scales are interchangeable measures of depression. The present paper investigates to which degree 7 common depression scales differ in their item content and generalizability. Methods: A content analysis is carried out to determine symptom overlap among the 7 scales via the Jaccard index (0=no overlap, 1=full overlap). Per scale, rates of idiosyncratic symptoms, and rates of specific vs. compound symptoms, are computed. Results: The 7 instruments encompass 52 disparate symptoms. Mean overlap among all scales is low (0.36), mean overlap of each scale with all others ranges from 0.27 to 0.40, overlap among individual scales from 0.26 to 0.61. Symptoms feature across a mean of 3 scales, 40\% of the symptoms appear in only a single scale, 12\% across all instruments. Scales differ regarding their rates of idiosyncratic symptoms (0–33\%) and compound symptoms (22–90\%). Limitations: Future studies analyzing more and different scales will be required to obtain a better estimate of the number of depression symptoms; the present content analysis was carried out conservatively and likely underestimates heterogeneity across the 7 scales. Conclusion: The substantial heterogeneity of the depressive syndrome and low overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a threat to the replicability and generalizability of depression research. Implications and future research opportunities are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background The DSM-5 encompasses a wide range of symptoms for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Symptoms are commonly added up to sum-scores, and thresholds differentiate between healthy and depressed individuals. The underlying assumption is that all patients diagnosed with MDD have a similar condition, and that sum-scores accurately reflect the severity of this condition. To test this assumption, we examined the number of DSM-5 depression symptom patterns in the "Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression" (STAR*D) study. Methods We investigated the number of unique symptom profiles reported by 3,703 depressed outpatients at the beginning of the first treatment stage of STAR*D. Results Overall, we identified 1,030 unique symptom profiles. Of these profiles, 864 profiles (83.9\%) were endorsed by five or fewer subjects, and 501 profiles (48.6\%) were endorsed by only one individual. The most common symptom profile exhibited a frequency of only 1.8\%. Controlling for overall depression severity did not reduce the amount of observed heterogeneity. Limitations Symptoms were dichotomized to construct symptom profiles. Many subjects enrolled in STAR*D reported medical conditions for which prescribed medications may have affected symptom presentation. Conclusions The substantial symptom variation among individuals who all qualify for one diagnosis calls into question the status of MDD as a specific consistent syndrome and offers a potential explanation for the difficulty in documenting treatment efficacy. We suggest that the analysis of individual symptoms, their patterns, and their causal associations will provide insights that could not be discovered in studies relying on only sum-scores.},

Most work reads like an exercise in model fitting, and falls short of theory building and testing in three ways. First, statistical and theoretical models are conflated, leading to invalid inferences such as the existence of psychological constructs based on factor models, or recommendations for clinical interventions based on network models. I demonstrate this inferential gap in a simulation: excellent model fit does little to corroborate a theory, regardless of quality or quantity of data. Second, researchers fail to explicate theories about psychological constructs, but use implicit causal beliefs to guide inferences. These latent theories have led to problematic best practices. Third, explicated theories are often weak theories: imprecise descriptions vulnerable to hidden assumptions and unknowns. Such theories do not offer precise predictions, and it is often unclear whether statistical effects actually corroborate weak theories or not. I demonstrate that these three challenges are common and harmful, and impede theory formation, failure, and reform. Matching theoretical and statistical models is necessary to bring data to bear on theories, and a renewed focus on theoretical psychology and formalizing theories offers a way forward.},

Known as the “critical positivity ratio,” this finding was supposedly derived from the famous Lorenz equation in physics by using the mathematics of nonlinear dynamic systems, and was defined precisely as “2.9013.” This exact number was widely touted as a great discovery by many leaders of positive psychology, had tremendous impact in various applied areas of psychology, and, more broadly, and was extensively cited in both the scientific literature and in the global popular media. However, this finding has been demonstrated to be bogus. Since its advent as a relatively new subdiscipline, positive psychology has claimed superiority to its precursor, the subdiscipline of humanistic psychology, in terms of supposedly both using more rigorous science and avoiding popularizing nonsense. The debunking of the critical positivity ratio demonstrates that positive psychology did not live up to these claims, and this has important implications, which are discussed in terms of “romantic scientism” and “voodoo science.” In addition, articles in the special issue on the “Implications of Debunking the ‘Critical Positivity Ratio’ for Humanistic Psychology” are introduced, as they also delve into these concerns.},

In March 2020, during the beginning of the outbreak in the Netherlands, we used ecological momentary assessment to follow 80 undergraduate students four times per day for 14 days to assess mental health, social contact, and COVID-19-related variables. Despite rapidly increasing rates of infections and deaths, we observed decreases in anxiety, loneliness, and COVID-19-related concerns, especially in the first few days. Other mental health variables, such as stress levels, remained stable, whereas depressive symptoms increased. Despite social-distancing measures implemented by the Dutch government halfway through our study, students showed no changes in the frequency of in-person social activities. Dynamic network models identified potential vicious cycles between mental health variables and being alone, which predicted concerns about COVID-19 and was followed by further mental health problems. Findings and implications are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {Since the introduction of mental disorders as networks of causally interacting symptoms, this novel framework has received considerable attention. The past years have resulted in over 40 scientific publications and numerous conference symposia and workshops. Now is an excellent moment to take stock of the network approach: What are its most fundamental challenges, and what are potential ways forward in addressing them? After a brief conceptual introduction, we first discuss challenges to network theory: (1) What is the validity of the network approach beyond some commonly investigated disorders such as major depression? (2) How do we best define psychopathological networks and their constituent elements? And (3) how can we gain a better understanding of the causal nature and real-life underpinnings of associations among symptoms? Next, after a short technical introduction to network modeling, we discuss challenges to network methodology: (4) heterogeneity of samples studied with network analytic models, and (5) a lurking replicability crisis in this strongly data-driven and exploratory field. Addressing these challenges may propel the network approach from its adolescence into adulthood and promises advances in understanding psychopathology both at the nomothetic and idiographic level.},

  abstract = {Major depression (MD) is a highly heterogeneous diagnostic category. Diverse symptoms such as sad mood, anhedonia, and fatigue are routinely added to an unweighted sum-score, and cutoffs are used to distinguish between depressed participants and healthy controls. Researchers then investigate outcome variables like MD risk factors, biomarkers, and treatment response in such samples. These practices presuppose that (1) depression is a discrete condition, and that (2) symptoms are interchangeable indicators of this latent disorder. Here I review these two assumptions, elucidate their historical roots, show how deeply engrained they are in psychological and psychiatric research, and document that they contrast with evidence. Depression is not a consistent syndrome with clearly demarcated boundaries, and depression symptoms are not interchangeable indicators of an underlying disorder. Current research practices lump individuals with very different problems into one category, which has contributed to the remarkably slow progress in key research domains such as the development of efficacious antidepressants or the identification of biomarkers for depression. The recently proposed network framework offers an alternative to the problematic assumptions. MD is not understood as a distinct condition, but as heterogeneous symptom cluster that substantially overlaps with other syndromes such as anxiety disorders. MD is not framed as an underlying disease with a number of equivalent indicators, but as a network of symptoms that have direct causal influence on each other: insomnia can cause fatigue which then triggers concentration and psychomotor problems. This approach offers new opportunities for constructing an empirically based classification system and has broad implications for future research.},

In this Perspective, we suggest that such progress depends crucially on our ability to measure depression. We review the many problems with depression measurement, including the limited evidence of validity and reliability. These issues raise grave concerns about common uses of depression measures, such as for diagnosis or tracking treatment progress. We argue that shortcomings arise because the measurement of depression rests on shaky methodological and theoretical foundations. Moving forward, we need to break with the field’s tradition, which has, for decades, divorced theories about depression from how we measure it. Instead, we suggest that epistemic iteration, an iterative exchange between theory and measurement, provides a crucial avenue for progressing how we measure depression.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies investigating the link between depressive symptoms and inflammation have yielded inconsistent results, which may be due to two factors. First, studies differed regarding the specific inflammatory markers studied and covariates accounted for. Second, specific depressive symptoms may be differentially related to inflammation. We address both challenges using network psychometrics. METHODS: We estimated seven regularized Mixed Graphical Models in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) data (N = 2321) to explore shared variances among (1) depression severity, modeled via depression sum-score, nine DSM-5 symptoms, or 28 individual depressive symptoms; (2) inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α); (3) before and after adjusting for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), exercise, smoking, alcohol, and chronic diseases. RESULTS: The depression sum-score was related to both IL-6 and CRP before, and only to IL-6 after covariate adjustment. When modeling the DSM-5 symptoms and CRP in a conceptual replication of Jokela et al., CRP was associated with 'sleep problems', 'energy level', and 'weight/appetite changes'; only the first two links survived covariate adjustment. In a conservative model with all 38 variables, symptoms and markers were unrelated. Following recent psychometric work, we re-estimated the full model without regularization: the depressive symptoms 'insomnia', 'hypersomnia', and 'aches and pain' showed unique positive relations to all inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence for differential relations between markers, depressive symptoms, and covariates. Associations between symptoms and markers were attenuated after covariate adjustment; BMI and sex consistently showed strong relations with inflammatory markers.},

  abstract = {Resilience factors (RFs) help prevent mental health problems after childhood adversity (CA). RFs are known to be related, but it is currently unknown how their interrelations facilitate mental health. Here, we used network analysis to examine the interrelations between ten RFs in 14-year-old adolescents exposed (‘CA’; n\,=\,638) and not exposed to CA (‘no-CA’; n\,=\,501). We found that the degree to which RFs are assumed to enhance each other is higher in the no-CA compared to the CA group. Upon correction for general distress levels, the global RF connectivity also differed between the two groups. More specifically, in the no-CA network almost all RFs were positively interrelated and thus may enhance each other, whereas in the CA network some RFs were negatively interrelated and thus may hamper each other. Moreover, the CA group showed more direct connections between the RFs and current distress. Therefore, CA seems to influence how RFs relate to each other and to current distress, potentially leading to a dysfunctional RF system. Translational research could explore whether intervening on negative RF interrelations so that they turn positive and RFs can enhance each other, may alter ‘RF-mental distress’ relations, resulting in a lower risk for subsequent mental health problems.},

  abstract = {Background: Up to half of Western children and adolescents experience at least one type of childhood adversity. Individuals with a history of childhood adversity have an increased risk of psychopathology. Resilience enhancing factors reduce the risk of psychopathology following childhood adversity. A comprehensive overview of empirically supported resilience factors is critically important for interventions aimed to increase resilience in young people. Moreover, such an overview may aid the development of novel resilience theories. Therefore, we conducted the first systematic review of social, emotional, cognitive and/ or behavioural resilience factors after childhood adversity. Methods: We systematically searched Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus (e.g. including MEDLINE) for English, Dutch and German literature. We included cohort studies that examined whether a resilience factor was a moderator and/ or a mediator for the relationship between childhood adversity and psychopathology in young people (mean age 13-24). Therefore, studies were included if the resilience factor was assessed prior to psychopathology, and childhood adversity was assessed no later than the resilience factor. Study data extraction was based on the STROBE report and study quality was assessed with an adapted version of Downs and Black’s scale. The preregistered protocol can be found at: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display\_record.asp?ID=CRD42016051978. Results: The search identified 1969 studies, of which 22 were included (eight nationalities, study sample n range: 59-6780). We found empirical support for 13 of 25 individual-level (e.g. high self-esteem, low rumination), six of 12 family-level (e.g. high family cohesion, high parental involvement), and one of five community-level resilience factors (i.e. high social support), to benefit mental health in young people exposed to childhood adversity. Single versus multiple resilience factor models supported the notion that resilience factors should not be studied in isolation, and that interrelations between resilience factors should be taken into account when predicting psychopathology after childhood adversity. Conclusions: Interventions that improve individual, family, and/ or social support resilience factors may reduce the risk of psychopathology following childhood adversity. Future research should scrutinize whether resilience factors function as a complex interrelated system that benefits mental health resilience after childhood adversity.},

Zu suchen wäre daher nach einem Paradigma, das die Psychiatrie als Beziehungsmedizin im übergreifenden Sinn begründen kann: als die Wissenschaft und Praxis von biologischen, psychischen und sozialen Beziehungen und ihren Störungen. In einem solchen Paradigma ließe sich auch das Gehirn als zentrales „Beziehungsorgan“ ohne reduktionistische Verengungen begreifen und erforschen.},

Allerdings bemühen sich nur wenige Untersuchungen um die Integration in die Versorgungssituation. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersuchte die Implementierbarkeit einer internet-basierten Intervention in die ambulante Versorgung von Personen mit depressiven Symptomen während der Wartezeit auf einen Psychotherapieplatz in einer psychotherapeutischen Hochschulambulanz.   Material und Methoden Die Teilnehmer auf der Warteliste für einen ambulanten Psychotherapieplatz wurden zufällig entweder einer Kontrollgruppe oder einer Interventionsgruppe, die einen Zugang zu dem internet-basierten Programm Deprexis während der Wartezeit bekam, zugeteilt. Die depressive Symptomatik wurde vor und nach der Wartezeit erfasst. Außerdem wurden Erwartungen der Teilnehmer erfragt und die Nutzungsdauer des Programms explorativ untersucht.   Ergebnisse Nur etwa die Hälfte der Personen, die über die Studie informiert wurden, bekundeten Interesse. Teilnehmer, die mit dem Programm Deprexis arbeiten konnten, nutzen im Schnitt nur die Hälfte der dargebotenen Themeneinheiten. In beiden Gruppen sank die depressive Symptomatik während der Wartezeit, die Verbesserung war jedoch nicht signifikant.   Diskussion Bei der Integration internet-basierter Interventionen in die Regelversorgung sollte zukünftig eine Anleitung und Begleitung durch einen Psychotherapeuten angedacht sowie Präferenzen der Teilnehmer berücksichtigt werden, um die Adhärenz und damit auch potentiell die Effektivität des Programms zu steigern.

  abstract = {The past 2 decades have seen increasing use of experience sampling methods (ESMs) to gain insights into the daily experience of affective states (e.g., its variability, as well as antecedents and consequences of temporary shifts in affect). Much less attention has been given to methodological challenges, such as how to ensure reliability of test scores obtained using ESM. The present study demonstrates the use of dynamic factor analysis (DFA) to quantify reliability of test scores in ESM contexts, evaluates the potential impact of unreliable test scores, and seeks to identify characteristics of individuals that may account for their unreliable test scores. One hundred twenty-seven participants completed baseline measures (demographics and personality traits), followed by a 7-day ESM phase in which positive and negative state affect were measured up to 6 times per day. Analyses showed that although at the sample level, scores on these affect measures exhibited adequate levels of reliability, up to one third of participants failed to meet conventional standards of reliability. Where these low reliability estimates were not significantly associated with personality factors, they could—in some cases—be explained by model misspecification where a meaningful alternative structure was available. Despite these potential differences in factor structure across participants, subsequent modeling with and without these 'unreliable' cases showed similar substantive results.

  abstract = {Effect sizes are underappreciated and often misinterpreted—the most common mistakes being to describe them in ways that are uninformative (e.g., using arbitrary standards) or misleading (e.g., squaring effect-size rs). We propose that effect sizes can be usefully evaluated by comparing them with well-understood benchmarks or by considering them in terms of concrete consequences. In that light, we conclude that when reliably estimated (a critical consideration), an effect-size r of .05 indicates an effect that is very small for the explanation of single events but potentially consequential in the not-very-long run, an effect-size r of .10 indicates an effect that is still small at the level of single events but potentially more ultimately consequential, an effect-size r of .20 indicates a medium effect that is of some explanatory and practical use even in the short run and therefore even more important, and an effect-size r of .30 indicates a large effect that is potentially powerful in both the short and the long run. A very large effect size (r = .40 or greater) in the context of psychological research is likely to be a gross overestimate that will rarely be found in a large sample or in a replication. Our goal is to help advance the treatment of effect sizes so that rather than being numbers that are ignored, reported without interpretation, or interpreted superficially or incorrectly, they become aspects of research reports that can better inform the application and theoretical development of psychological research.},

However, employing this method to answer organizational research questions comes with a number of complex?and often difficult?decisions surrounding: (1) how the implementation of ESM can advance or elucidate prior between-person theorizing at the within-person level of analysis, (2) how scholars should effectively and efficiently assess within-person constructs, and (3) analytic concerns regarding the proper modeling of interdependent assessments and trends while controlling for potentially confounding factors. The current paper addresses these challenges via a panel of seven researchers who are familiar not only with implementing this methodology but also related theoretical and analytic challenges in this domain. The current paper provides timely, actionable insights aimed toward addressing several complex issues that scholars often face when implementing ESM in their research.},

  abstract = {Psychological researchers often seek to obtain cluster solutions from sparse count matrices (e.g., social networks; counts of symptoms that are in common for two given individuals; structural brain imaging). Increasingly, community detection methods are being used to subset the data in a data-driven manner. While many of these approaches perform well in simulation studies and thus offer some improvement upon traditional clustering approaches, there is no readily available approach for evaluating the robustness of these solutions in empirical data. Researchers have no way of knowing if their results are due to noise. We describe here two approaches novel to the field of psychology that enable evaluation of cluster solution robustness. This tutorial also explains the use of an associated R package, perturbR, which provides researchers with the ability to use the methods described herein. In the first approach, the cluster assignment from the original matrix is compared against cluster assignments obtained by randomly perturbing the edges in the matrix. Stable cluster solutions should not demonstrate large changes in the presence of small perturbations. For the second approach, Monte Carlo simulations of random matrices that have the same properties as the original matrix are generated. The distribution of quality scores (“modularity”) obtained from the cluster solutions from these matrices are then compared with the score obtained from the original matrix results. From this, one can assess if the results are better than what would be expected by chance. perturbR automates these two methods, providing an easy-to-use resource for psychological researchers. We demonstrate the utility of this package using benchmark simulated data generated from a previous study and then apply the methods to publicly available empirical data obtained from social networks and structural neuroimaging.},

  abstract = {At its best, connectivity mapping can offer researchers great insight into how spatially disparate regions of the human brain coordinate activity during brain processing. A recent investigation conducted by Smith and colleagues (2011) on methods for estimating connectivity maps suggested that those which attempt to ascertain the direction of influence among ROIs rarely provide reliable results. Another problem gaining increasing attention is heterogeneity in connectivity maps. Most group-level methods require that the data come from homogeneous samples, and misleading findings may arise from current methods if the connectivity maps for individuals vary across the sample (which is likely the case). The utility of maps resulting from effective connectivity on the individual or group levels is thus diminished because they do not accurately inform researchers. The present paper introduces a novel estimation technique for fMRI researchers, Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME), which demonstrates that using information across individuals assists in the recovery of the existence of connections among ROIs used by Smith and colleagues (2011) and the direction of the influence. Using heterogeneous in-house data, we demonstrate that GIMME offers a unique improvement over current approaches by arriving at reliable group and individual structures even when the data are highly heterogeneous across individuals comprising the group. An added benefit of GIMME is that it obtains reliable connectivity map estimates equally well using the data from resting state, block, or event-related designs. GIMME provides researchers with a powerful, flexible tool for identifying directed connectivity maps at the group and individual levels.},

  abstract = {Researchers who collect multivariate time-series data across individuals must decide whether to model the dynamic processes at the individual level or at the group level. A recent innovation, group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME), offers one solution to this dichotomy by identifying group-level time-series models in a data-driven manner while also reliably recovering individual-level patterns of dynamic effects. GIMME is unique in that it does not assume homogeneity in processes across individuals in terms of the patterns or weights of temporal effects. However, it can be difficult to make inferences from the nuances in varied individual-level patterns. The present article introduces an algorithm that arrives at subgroups of individuals that have similar dynamic models. Importantly, the researcher does not need to decide the number of subgroups. The final models contain reliable group-, subgroup-, and individual-level patterns that enable generalizable inferences, subgroups of individuals with shared model features, and individual-level patterns and estimates. We show that integrating community detection into the GIMME algorithm improves upon current standards in two important ways: (1) providing reliable classification and (2) increasing the reliability in the recovery of individual-level effects. We demonstrate this method on functional MRI from a sample of former American football players.},

In Study 2, children with ADHD were randomly assigned a physical activity or a sedentary task before working on a task requiring executive control. Results: Lack of physical activity was shown to relate to depressed affect, more strongly in participants with severe hyperactivity symptoms (Study 1). The physically active participants showed improved executive functioning after only 5 min of vigorous activity; the sedentary control participants showed no improvement (Study 2). Conclusion: These results indicate that interventions to increase the level of physical activity in children with and without ADHD might improve affect and executive functioning.},

  abstract = {Objective Sleep dysregulation is highly prevalent in bipolar disorders (BDs), with previous actigraphic studies demonstrating sleep abnormalities during depressive, manic, and interepisode periods. We undertook a meta-analysis of published actigraphy studies to identify whether any abnormalities in the reported sleep profiles of remitted BD cases differ from controls. Method A systematic review identified independent studies that were eligible for inclusion in a random effects meta-analysis. Effect sizes for actigraphy parameters were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). Results Nine of 248 identified studies met eligibility criteria. Compared with controls (N = 210), remitted BD cases (N = 202) showed significant differences in SMD for sleep latency (0.51 [0.28–0.73]), sleep duration (0.57 [0.30–0.84]), wake after sleep onset (WASO) (0.28 [0.06–0.50]) and sleep efficiency (−0.38 [−0.70–0.07]). Moderate heterogeneity was identified for sleep duration (I2 = 44\%) and sleep efficiency (I2 = 44\%). Post hoc meta-regression analyses demonstrated that larger SMD for sleep duration were identified for studies with a greater age difference between BD cases and controls (β = 0.22; P = 0.03) and non-significantly lower levels of residual depressive symptoms in BD cases (β = −0.13; P = 0.07). Conclusion This meta-analysis of sleep in remitted bipolar disorder highlights disturbances in several sleep parameters. Future actigraphy studies should pay attention to age matching and levels of residual depressive symptoms.},

Complexity measures may identify previously unexplored aspects of objectively measured activity patterns, such as the extent to which individuals show repetitive periods of physical activity and the diversity in durations of such repetitive activity patterns. We compared the complexity levels of actigraphy data gathered over 4 weeks (\$\$\textbackslash sim 40000\$\$data points each) for every individual, from non-depressed (\$\$n=25\$\$) and depressed (\$\$n=21\$\$) groups using recurrence plots. Significantly lower levels of complexity were detected in the actigraphy data from the depressed group as compared to non-depressed controls, both in terms of lower mean durations of periods of recurrent physical activity and less diversity in the duration of these periods. Further, diagnosis of depression was not significantly associated with mean activity levels or measures of circadian rhythm stability, and predicted depression status better than these.},

  abstract = {Disruptions in activity are core features of mood states in bipolar disorder (BD). In this study, we sought to identify activity patterns that discriminate between mood states in BD. Locomotor activity was collected by using actigraphy for 6 weeks in participants with interepisode BD Type I (n = 37) or participants with no lifetime mood disorders (n = 39). The 24-hr activity pattern of each participant-day was characterized and within-person differences in activity patterns were examined across mood states. Results showed that among participants with BD, depressive days are distinguished from other mood states by an overall lower activity level and a pattern of later activity onset, a midday elevation of activity, and low evening activity. No distinct within-person activity patterns were found for hypomanic/manic days. Given that activity can be monitored noninvasively for extended time periods, activity pattern identification may be leveraged to detect mood states in BD, thereby providing more immediate delivery of care.},

  abstract = {Vector autoregressions (VARs) are flexible time series models that can capture complex dynamic interrelationships among macroeconomic variables. However, their dense parameterization leads to unstable inference and inaccurate out-of-sample forecasts, particularly for models with many variables. A solution to this problem is to use informative priors in order to shrink the richly parameterized unrestricted model toward a parsimonious naıve benchmark, and thus reduce estimation uncertainty. This paper studies the optimal choice of the informativeness of these priors, which we treat as additional parameters, in the spirit of hierarchical modeling. This approach, theoretically grounded and easy to implement, greatly reduces the number and importance of subjective choices in the setting of the prior. Moreover, it performs very well in terms of both out-of-sample forecasting—as well as factor models—and accuracy in the estimation of impulse response functions.},

  abstract = {Background Limited research has explored the links between sedentary behaviour, mental health and quality of life. This study examines objectively measured sedentary behaviour and perceived mental health and quality of life across week days and weekends. Methods 42 adults (19M, 23F; mean age 38yrs (range 18–67) \& BMI 24.8kg/m2 (range 18.7–33.8) wore an activPAL monitor 24h/day for one week and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and SF12 Health Survey. Average weekday and weekend day sitting time was computed. Differences between sitting (Group 1 = {$<$}8hrs/day, Group 2 = 8–10 hrs/day, Group 3 = {$>$}10hrs/day) and components of the HADS and SF12 health survey were examined using an ANCOVA with a measure of physical activity (step count) included as a covariate. Results Average sitting time on a weekday was 9hrs 29mins (range 5hrs 52mins to 12hrs 55mins) and 8hrs 59mins (range 4hrs, 07mins to 14hrs, 40mins) on a weekend day. There was a main effect (p{$<$}0.05) for weekday sitting time on total anxiety and depression (HADS) and mental health and vitality (SF12). Planned contrasts identified individuals in group 1 had lower anxiety and depression and higher mental health and vitality scores than individuals in groups 2 or 3 (p{$<$}0.05). No difference was found between individuals in group 2 and group 3 (p{$>$}0.05). No main effects were found for weekend sitting (p{$>$}0.05). Conclusions Weekday sitting time below 8 hours/day is associated with better perceived mental health and quality of life.},

  abstract = {When analyzing data researchers make some decisions that are either arbitrary, based on subjective beliefs about the data generating process, or for which equally justifiable alternative choices could have been made. This wide range of data-analytic choices can be abused, and has been one of the underlying causes of the replication crisis in several fields. Recently, the introduction of multiverse analysis provides researchers with a method to evaluate the stability of the results across reasonable choices that could be made when analyzing data. Multiverse analysis is confined to a descriptive role, lacking a proper and comprehensive inferential procedure. Recently, specification curve analysis adds an inferential procedure to multiverse analysis, but this approach is limited to simple cases related to the linear model, and only allows researchers to infer whether at least one specification rejects the null hypothesis, but not which specifications should be selected. In this paper we present a Post-selection Inference approach to Multiverse Analysis (PIMA) which is a flexible and general inferential approach that accounts for all possible models, i.e., the multiverse of reasonable analyses. The approach allows for a wide range of data specifications (i.e. pre-processing) and any generalized linear model; it allows testing the null hypothesis of a given predictor not being associated with the outcome, by merging information from all reasonable models of multiverse analysis, and provides strong control of the family-wise error rate such that it allows researchers to claim that the null-hypothesis can be rejected for each specification that shows a significant effect. The inferential proposal is based on a conditional resampling procedure. To be continued...},

  abstract = {Abstract Ensemble prediction systems typically show positive spread-error correlation, but they are subject to forecast bias and dispersion errors, and are therefore uncalibrated. This work proposes the use of ensemble model output statistics (EMOS), an easy-to-implement postprocessing technique that addresses both forecast bias and underdispersion and takes into account the spread-skill relationship. The technique is based on multiple linear regression and is akin to the superensemble approach that has traditionally been used for deterministic-style forecasts. The EMOS technique yields probabilistic forecasts that take the form of Gaussian predictive probability density functions (PDFs) for continuous weather variables and can be applied to gridded model output. The EMOS predictive mean is a bias-corrected weighted average of the ensemble member forecasts, with coefficients that can be interpreted in terms of the relative contributions of the member models to the ensemble, and provides a highly competitive deterministic-style forecast. The EMOS predictive variance is a linear function of the ensemble variance. For fitting the EMOS coefficients, the method of minimum continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) estimation is introduced. This technique finds the coefficient values that optimize the CRPS for the training data. The EMOS technique was applied to 48-h forecasts of sea level pressure and surface temperature over the North American Pacific Northwest in spring 2000, using the University of Washington mesoscale ensemble. When compared to the bias-corrected ensemble, deterministic-style EMOS forecasts of sea level pressure had root-mean-square error 9\% less and mean absolute error 7\% less. The EMOS predictive PDFs were sharp, and much better calibrated than the raw ensemble or the bias-corrected ensemble.},

Probabilistic forecasting aims to maximize the sharpness of the predictive distributions, subject to calibration, on the basis of the available information set. We formalize and study notions of calibration in a prediction space setting. In practice, probabilistic calibration can be checked by examining probability integral transform (PIT) histograms. Proper scoring rules such as the logarithmic score and the continuous ranked probability score serve to assess calibration and sharpness simultaneously. As a special case, consistent scoring functions provide decision-theoretically coherent tools for evaluating point forecasts.

Unlike other methods, EGA produces a visual guide––network plot––that not only indicates the number of dimensions to retain, but also which items cluster together and their level of association. Although previous studies have found EGA to be superior to traditional methods, they are limited in the conditions considered. These issues are here addressed through an extensive simulation study that incorporates a wide range of plausible structures that may be found in practice, including continuous and dichotomous data, and unidimensional and multidimensional structures. Additionally, two new EGA techniques are presented, one that extends EGA to also deal with unidimensional structures, and the other based on the triangulated maximally filtered graph approach (EGAtmfg). Both EGA techniques are compared with five widely used factor analytic techniques. Overall, EGA and EGAtmfg are found to perform as well as the most accurate traditional method, parallel analysis, and to produce the best large-sample properties of all the methods evaluated. To facilitate the use and application of EGA, we present a straightforward R tutorial on how to apply and interpret EGA, using scores from a well-known psychological instrument: the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale.},

  abstract = {In the last half of the 20th century, psychology and neuroscience have experienced a renewed interest in intraindividual variation. To date, there are few quantitative methods to evaluate whether a population structure (between-person) is likely to hold for individual people. We present a network information theoretic approach to evaluate the extent to which a system possesses the ergodic property. We introduce a new metric, the ergodicity information index (EII), that can inform whether a set of multivariate time series (or a set of intensive longitudinal measures) should be represented as multiple individual structures or as a single population structure. The EII index quantifies the amount of information lost by representing all individuals with a single population structure. If the individuals don't have a similar structure, representing them with a single population network leads to a loss of information. The EII index value will be higher than in cases where all individuals have a similar structure. A Monte-Carlo simulation is implemented to test the EII index, and the results show that the new index has a 94\% accuracy in differentiating data in which all individuals have a similar structure vs. data in which the individuals don't have a similar structure. The paper also presents two new techniques designed to help applied researchers to analyze data when the ergodicity property does not hold. The EII bootstrap test obtains a sampling distribution of EII values as if all participants in the data have the population network structure and compare this null distribution to the empirical EII value. Significant differences indicate that the empirical data cannot be expected to be generated from an ergodic process, and the population structure is not sufficient to describe all individuals. The Domenico clustering method estimates the Von Neumann entropy of two networks and computes their Jensen-Shannon Distance (JSD). Then, a complete-linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering method is applied to the JSD, and the clustering partitioning is obtained via modularization maximization. The Domenico clustering method allows the discovery of groups of individuals with a similar structure. Finally, two empirical examples are shown, one using data from an intensive longitudinal experience sampling study examining Big Five personality measured by the Big Five Inventory-2, and the other using resting state neuroimaging data taken from a study examining creativity which used the 268-node Shen brain atlas. Starting with personality, the bootstrap EII test was significant, suggesting that the BFI-2 data were nonergodic. Following up on the bootstrap EII test, the information clustering was applied, and the single cluster test was performed. The single cluster test suggested that the empirical networks had significantly greater JSD values than the random networks meaning that the single cluster detected was not meaningful, and each individual in the sample is unique. The brain networks had a significant bootstrap EII test and significantly larger JSD values than random networks. These results, in line with the personality data, suggest that (resting state) brain networks are not ergodic, and no meaningful groups can be formed (i.e., each individual is unique). In sum, the personality and (resting state) brain networks do not possess ergodicity and therefore lose information when data are aggregated into a single population.},

However, current resilience resources significantly moderated this effect. Among individuals who reported multiple ACE, higher resilience resources were associated with lower IL-6 levels.These data suggest that resilience resources might attenuate the association between ACE and later health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Visual short-term memory (vSTM) is often measured via continuous-report tasks whereby participants are presented with stimuli that vary along a continuous dimension (e.g., colour) with the goal of memorising the stimulus features. At test, participants are probed to recall the feature value of one of the memoranda in a continuous manner (e.g., by clicking on a colour wheel). The angular deviation between the participant response and the true feature value provides an estimate of recall precision. Two prominent models of performance on such tasks are the two- and three-component mixture models (Bays et al., Journal of Vision, 9(10), Article 7, 2009; Zhang and Luck, Nature, 453(7192), 233–235, 2008). Both models decompose participant responses into probabilistic mixtures of: (1) responses to the true target value based on a noisy memory representation; (2) random guessing when memory fails. In addition, the three-component model proposes (3) responses to a non-target feature value (i.e., binding errors). Here we report the development of mixtur, an open-source package written for the statistical programming language R that facilitates the fitting of the two- and three-component mixture models to continuous report data. We also conduct simulations to develop recommendations for researchers on trial numbers, set sizes, and memoranda similarity, as well as parameter recovery and model recovery. In the Discussion, we discuss how mixtur can be used to fit the slots and the slots-plus-averaging models, as well as how mixtur can be extended to fit explanatory models of visual short-term memory. It is our hope that mixtur will lower the barrier of entry for utilising mixture modelling.},

While this has no impact on the fit metrics in ML estimation, it can potentially lead to varying Bayesian model comparison metrics due to the use of different prior distributions under each parameterization. This is a problem, because a researcher could artificially improve one’s preferred model simply by changing the identification constraint. Using a single-factor CFA as motivation for study, we first show that Bayesian model comparison metrics can systematically change depending on constraints used. We then study principled methods for setting the scale of the latent variable that stabilize the model comparison metrics. These methods involve (i) the placement of priors on ratios of factor loadings, as opposed to individual loadings; and (ii) use of effect coding. We illustrate the methods via simulation and application.},

Yet retrospective aggregate assessments are susceptible to memory recall and retrieval difficulties. This study examined the correspondence between a month of real-time experience sampling methodology (ESM) reports of traumatic stress symptoms and a retrospective assessment of past-month traumatic stress symptoms for that same period. Participants were a convenience community sample (n=96) from Southern and Central Israel exposed to rocket fire during the Israel-Gaza July-Aug 2014 conflict. Participants provided ESM reports on traumatic stress symptoms twice a day for 30 days via smartphone. Average ESM scores, rather than peak or most recent reports, were most highly correlated with retrospective assessments. For individual symptoms, concentration difficulties had the highest correspondence between ESM and retrospective reports, while amnesia had the lowest correspondence. Regression analysis found that average ESM scores and younger age significantly predicted past-month retrospective assessments of PTSD symptoms. Additionally, previously experiencing more types of trauma predicted PTSD symptoms, but did not moderate the relationship between ESM and retrospective assessments. These findings have implications for assessment.},

Using the case of an exploratory factor analysis procedure—principal axis factoring (PAF) and promax rotation—we show that this assumption is not always justified. Procedures with equal names are sometimes implemented differently across programs: a jingle fallacy. Focusing on two popular statistical analysis programs, we indeed discovered a jingle jungle for the above procedure: Both PAF and promax rotation are implemented differently in the psych R package and in SPSS. Based on analyses with 247 real and 216,000 simulated data sets implementing 108 different data structures, we show that these differences in implementations can result in fairly different factor solutions for a variety of different data structures. Differences in the solutions for real data sets ranged from negligible to very large, with 42\% displaying at least one different indicator-to-factor correspondence. A simulation study revealed systematic differences in accuracies between different implementations, and large variation between data structures, with small numbers of indicators per factor, high factor intercorrelations, and weak factors resulting in the lowest accuracies. Moreover, although there was no single combination of settings that was superior for all data structures, we identified implementations of PAF and promax that maximize performance on average. We recommend researchers to use these implementations as best way through the jungle, discuss model averaging as a potential alternative, and highlight the importance of adhering to best practices of scale construction.},

Therefore, ICD and DSM labels of depression, although useful from a service perspective, fail to help patients directly. This paper will show, using the author’s experiences as an example, that patients with mood disorders can ‘‘diagnose’’ the natural phenotype, in the sense that systematic recording of painful fluctuations in environmentally reactive moods by the patient him- or herself may: (i) not only provide an accurate assessment of depression, but (ii) result in a process of conscious awareness of aberrant responses to the environment 7 a first step on the way to recovery. Method: The author developed a rudimentary but useable method to diagnose his dynamic mood fluctuations over the years. The continuous assessment method allowed him to systematically score his mood and activities every day, enabling him to study and analyse in detail the course and context of mood symptoms over time. Results: With time, this initial strategy evolved into a new, more informed, more empowered diagnosis of his problems and ultimately contributed to a more resilient mind set with regard to mood changes and ways of active rather than avoidant coping with them. Conclusions: Many people with mood problems receive a DSM label but are not taught to engage in diagnosing what depression is: a dynamic pattern of environmentally reactive mood responses. Continuous diagnostic self-assessment strategies may help patients to learn, adjust and cope with their emotional vulnerabilities expressed as dimensional and reactive variation in mood. Patients can be empowered to diagnose experiences as a means to understand the sources and consequences of continuous mood variation over time.},

However, most psychologists refrain from explicitly addressing causal research questions and avoid drawing causal inference on the basis of nonexperimental evidence. We argue that this taboo against causal inference in nonexperimental psychology impairs study design and data analysis, holds back cumulative research, leads to a disconnect between original findings and how they are interpreted in subsequent work, and limits the relevance of nonexperimental psychology for policymaking. At the same time, the taboo does not prevent researchers from interpreting findings as causal effects—the inference is simply made implicitly, and assumptions remain unarticulated. Thus, we recommend that nonexperimental psychologists begin to talk openly about causal assumptions and causal effects. Only then can researchers take advantage of recent methodological advances in causal reasoning and analysis and develop a solid understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms that can inform future research, theory, and policymakers.},

Besides these successes, it becomes clear, that beyond pure prediction, which is the primary strength of most supervised machine learning algorithms, the quantification of uncertainty is relevant and necessary as well. While first concepts and ideas in this direction have emerged in recent years, this paper adopts a conceptual perspective and examines possible sources of uncertainty. By adopting the viewpoint of a statistician, we discuss the concepts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which are more commonly associated with machine learning. The paper aims to formalize the two types of uncertainty and demonstrates that sources of uncertainty are miscellaneous and can not always be decomposed into aleatoric and epistemic. Drawing parallels between statistical concepts and uncertainty in machine learning, we also demonstrate the role of data and their influence on uncertainty.},

This study examined within-person associations between physical activity and depressive mood in older adults across 7 days. Moreover, the study tested the extent to which need-fulfillment can explain this association. The sample consisted of 68 adults aged 65 to 93 years. Physical activity was assessed objectively with accelerometers, whereas need-fulfillment and depressive mood were assessed at the end of each day using self-reports. Results from multilevel analysis suggest that daily physical activity was negatively related to daily depressive mood within persons. Although need-fulfillment did not explain the association between physical activity and depressive mood, it was a statistically significant predictor of daily depressive mood and even attenuated the effect of physical activity on depressive mood to nonsignificance.},

  abstract = {There are proposals that extend the classical generalized additive models (GAMs) to accommodate high-dimensional data (p≫n\$\$ p\textbackslash gg n \$\$) using group sparse regularization. However, the sparse regularization may induce excess shrinkage when estimating smooth functions, damaging predictive performance. Moreover, most of these GAMs consider an “all-in-all-out” approach for functional selection, rendering them difficult to answer if nonlinear effects are necessary. While some Bayesian models can address these shortcomings, using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for model fitting creates a new challenge, scalability. Hence, we propose Bayesian hierarchical generalized additive models as a solution: we consider the smoothing penalty for proper shrinkage of curve interpolation via reparameterization. A novel two-part spike-and-slab LASSO prior for smooth functions is developed to address the sparsity of signals while providing extra flexibility to select the linear or nonlinear components of smooth functions. A scalable and deterministic algorithm, EM-Coordinate Descent, is implemented in an open-source R package BHAM. Simulation studies and metabolomics data analyses demonstrate improved predictive and computational performance against state-of-the-art models. Functional selection performance suggests trade-offs exist regarding the effect hierarchy assumption.},

  abstract = {Network Analysis is considered as a new method that challenges Latent Variable models in inferring psychological attributes. With Network Analysis, psychological attributes are derived from a complex system of components without the need to call on any latent variables. But the ontological status of psychological attributes is not adequately defined with Network Analysis, because a psychological attribute is both a complex system and a property emerging from this complex system. The aim of this article is to reappraise the legitimacy of latent variable models by engaging in an ontological and epistemological discussion on psychological attributes. Psychological attributes relate to the mental equilibrium of individuals embedded in their social interactions, as robust attractors within complex dynamic processes with emergent properties, distinct from physical entities located in precise areas of the brain. Latent variables thus possess legitimacy, because the emergent properties can be conceptualized and analyzed on the sole basis of their manifestations, without exploring the upstream complex system. However, in opposition with the usual Latent Variable models, this article is in favor of the integration of a dynamic system of manifestations. Latent Variables models and Network Analysis thus appear as complementary approaches. New approaches combining Latent Network Models and Network Residuals are certainly a promising new way to infer psychological attributes, placing psychological attributes in an inter-subjective dynamic approach. Pragmatism-realism appears as the epistemological framework required if we are to use latent variables as representations of psychological attributes.},

However, we theorize that sleep can actually increase risk for depressive symptoms in cognitively vulnerable individuals. This is because the negative cognitions generated by these individuals are strengthened and consolidated each night during sleep. Three studies were conducted to test this theory. Studies 1 (n ϭ 134) and 2 (n ϭ 47) used prospective designs and showed that undergraduates with high, but not low, levels of cognitive vulnerability were most likely to exhibit increases in depressive symptoms when sleeping well as operationalized by self-reported quality and objectively measured duration (via actigraphy). Study 3 (n ϭ 40) used an experimental design and provides the first causal evidence that it may be possible to prevent future depressive symptoms in cognitively at-risk undergraduates by restricting their sleep during times of high perceived stress.},

It is hailed as a significant improvement over other diagnostic taxonomies. However, the purported advantages and fundamental assumptions of HiTOP have received little, if any, scientific scrutiny. We critically evaluated five fundamental claims about HiTOP. We conclude that HiTOP does not demonstrate a high degree of verisimilitude and has the potential to hinder progress on understanding the etiology of psychopathology. It does not lend itself to theory building or taxonomic evolution, and it cannot account for multifinality, equifinality, or developmental and etiological processes. In its current form, HiTOP is not ready to use in clinical settings and may result in algorithmic bias against underrepresented groups. We recommend a bifurcation strategy moving forward in which the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is used in clinical settings while researchers focus on developing a falsifiable theory-based classification system.},

Few studies, however, have focused on understanding the nature of the PA – psychopathology relationship and existing research relies mostly on self-report PA measures, which are less reliable. In this study, we investigated the nature of the relationships between objectively measured light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and psychopathology symptoms in adolescents. Methods 934 adolescents (63\% female) aged 11–19 years from the SIGMA cohort wore the Fitbit Charge 2 measuring LPA and MVPA during at least three days. Participants completed the Brief Symptom Inventory-53, assessing general symptoms of psychopathology, depression, anxiety, and psychoticism. Model selection was conducted in a subset of the dataset (n~=~464) to determine the best fit. The optimal model was then fitted to the remainder of the dataset (n~=~470). Results The results from the selected linear model indicated a non-significant relationship between LPA, MVPA, and symptoms of general psychopathology, depression, anxiety, and psychoticism. Conclusions This study does not provide evidence that higher durations of LPA and MVPA alone relate to reduced symptoms of general psychopathology, depression, anxiety, and psychoticism in the general adolescent population. A more integrative approach considering the interdependency of multiple lifestyle factors, as well as the domain, context, and individual experience of PA may add value to the understanding of the PA-psychopathology relationship.},

  abstract = {For more than 50 years, psychology has been dominated by a top-down research strategy in which a simplistic account of the hypothetico-deductive method is paired with null hypothesis testing in order to test hypotheses and theories. As a consequence of this focus on testing, psychologists have failed to pay sufficient attention to a complementary, bottom-up research strategy in which data-to-theory research is properly pursued. This bottom-up strategy has 2 primary aspects: the detection of phenomena, mostly in the form of empirical generalizations, and the subsequent understanding of those phenomena through the abductive generation of explanatory theories. This article provides a methodologically informative account of phenomena detection with reference to psychology. It begins by presenting the important distinctions between data, phenomena, and theory. It then identifies a number of different methodological strategies that are used to identify empirical phenomena. Thereafter, it discusses aspects of the nature of science that are prompted by a consideration of the distinction between data, phenomena, and explanatory theory. Taken together, these considerations press for significant changes in the way we think about and practice psychological research. The adoption of these changes would help psychology correct a number of its major current research deficiencies.},

In this paper, we adopt the correspondence theory as a plausible theory of truth and relate it to science. First, we briefly outline the major extant theories of truth. We then present the correspondence theory in a form that enables us to show that the theory uniquely fulfills a crucial function in psychological research, because the interpretation of truth claims as suppositions that concern states of affairs in the world clearly explicates what it means for a theory to be true, and what it means for a theory to be false. For this reason, correspondence truth has the advantage of allowing researchers to properly understand the assumptions of scientific research as claims about the factual state of the world, and to scrutinize these assumptions. It is concluded that correspondence truth plays an important part in our understanding of science, including psychology.},

While analysts often report a single analysis without documenting how it was chosen, this can cause serious transparency and methodological issues. To make the sensitivity of analysis results to analytical choices transparent, some statisticians and methodologists advocate the use of ‘multiverse analysis’: reporting the full range of outcomes that result from all combinations of defensible analytic choices. Summarizing this combinatorial explosion of statistical results presents unique challenges; several approaches to visualizing the output of multiverse analyses have been proposed across a variety of fields (e.g. psychology, statistics, economics, neuroscience). In this article, we (1) introduce a consistent conceptual framework and terminology for multiverse analyses that can be applied across fields; (2) identify the tasks researchers try to accomplish when visualizing multiverse analyses and (3) classify multiverse visualizations into ‘archetypes’, assessing how well each archetype supports each task. Our work sets a foundation for subsequent research on developing visualization tools and techniques to support multiverse analysis and its reporting.},

Though the inherent flexibility in EMA has its benefits, no resource exists to provide an overview of the variability in how convergent constructs and symptoms have been assessed in the past. The present study fills that gap by examining EMA measurement design for mood and anxiety symptomatology.Methods: Various search engines were used to identify 234 relevant studies. Items administered, data collection schedules (i.e., beeps per day), response scales (i.e., Likert), data collection platforms (i.e., apps), and psychometric properties (i.e., reliability) were extracted.Results: Study designs varied greatly in all aspects across the identified papers. Over 4,600 extracted items were qualitatively analyzed, resulting in the identification of 12 themes. The most EMA items focused on affect, with categories such as “happiness” and “tension” appearing most frequently. We provide all of our data extraction in the format of an open-source database.Limitations: Despite our best attempts to include as much of the relevant literature as possible, this review and the accompanying database are not exhaustive, but can easily be built upon to include other, newer studies.Conclusions: The fact that the affect theme featured both positive and negative emotional constructs highlights the dichotomous focus on valence and affect within the literature surrounding anxious and depressive symptomatology. We hope that our database will act as a helpful design decision-making resource for researchers studying this kind of symptomatology in the future.Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42019139409).},

However, the work of Peter Molenaar on ergodicity has raised concerns about the meaning and utility of this measure, especially when the interest is in discovering general laws that apply to (all) individuals. Through using Cattell’s databox and adopting a multilevel perspective, this paper provides a closer look at the cross-sectional correlation, with the goal to better understand its meaning when ergodicity is absent. An analytical expression is presented that shows the cross-sectional correlation is a function of the between-person correlation (based on person-specific means), and the within-person correlation (based on individuals’ temporal deviations from their person-specific means). Two curiosities related to this expression of the cross-sectional correlation are elaborated on, that is: a) the difference between the within-person correlation and the (average) person-specific correlation; and b) the unexpected scenarios that can arise because the cross-sectional correlation is a weighted sum rather than a weighted average of the between-person and within-person correlations. Seven specific examples are presented to illustrate various ways in which these two curiosities may combine; R code is provided, which allows researchers to investigate additional scenarios.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to introduce readers to the TAR model and the MSAR model and to illustrate the usefulness of these models for gaining more insight into the underlying dynamics of regime-switching processes such as the ones described earlier. In the first section we present these two models and discuss their main features and some important extensions. In the second section we present estimation procedures that can be used when there are missing data. In addition, we discuss the issue of model selection based on information criteria. The third section is an empirical application in which we compare the TAR and MSAR models with an ordinary AR model (i.e., a model without regime switching). To this end, we make use of daily mood scores obtained with the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule (Watson \& Clark, 1994) in an individual diagnosed with rapidly cycling bipolar disorder. Our aim was to determine whether there are two distinct regimes that represent a manic and a depressed state in this person’s daily affect scores. In addition, we were interested in the actual regime-switching mechanism, that is, whether shifts from depression to mania and vice versa are triggered by affect levels themselves (as in a kind of feedback loop) or whether this is an autonomous mechanism that operates independently of the actual affect levels. We end this chapter with a brief discussion of the potential of these models for psychological research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

In this article the specific condition is presented that must be satisfied to generalize from the interindividual level to the intraindividual level. A way to investigate whether this condition is satisfied is by means of multivariate time series analysis. More generally, time series analysis can be used to investigate psychological processes situated within individuals. In this article we consider a well established class of multivariate stationary time series models that may be used to study the intraindividual covariance structure. We demonstrate the application of some of these models with an empirical example consisting of state measurements of behavior associated with the Five Factor Model of Personality. We illustrate how one can investigate whether individuals are similar with respect to their intraindividual structure of variation, and whether this structure is similar to the structure of interindividual variation.},

  abstract = {Multilevel autoregressive models are popular choices for the analysis of intensive longitudinal data in psychology. Empirical studies have found a positive correlation between autoregressive parameters of affective time series and the between-person measures of psychopathology, a phenomenon known as the staging effect. However, it has been argued that such findings may represent a statistical artifact: Although common models assume normal error distributions, empirical data (for instance, measurements of negative affect among healthy individuals) often exhibit the floor effect, that is response distributions with high skewness, low mean, and low variability. In this paper, we investigated whether—and to what extent—the floor effect leads to erroneous conclusions by means of a simulation study. We describe three dynamic models which have meaningful substantive interpretations and can produce floor-effect data. We simulate multilevel data from these models, varying skewness but keeping the autoregressive parameter fixed across individuals, while also varying the number of time points and cases. Analyzing these data with the standard multilevel AR(1) model we found that positive bias only occurs when modeling with random residual variance, whereas modeling with fixed residual variance leads to negative bias. We discuss the implications of our study for data collection and modeling choices.},

Therefore, there exists a multiverse of possible data sets. A classic multiverse analysis involves performing a given analysis on every potential data set in this multiverse to examine how each data decision affects the results. However, a limitation of the multiverse analysis is that it addresses only data cleaning and analytic decisions, yet researcher decisions that affect results also happen at the data-collection stage. I propose an adaptation of the multiverse method in which the multiverse of data sets is composed of real data sets from studies varying in data-collection methods of interest. I walk through an example analysis applying the approach to 19 studies on shooting decisions to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach and conclude with a further discussion of the limitations and applications of this method.},

  abstract = {Background: Depression is a severe psychiatric disease with high prevalence and an elevated risk for recurrence and chronicity. A substantial proportion of individuals with a diagnosis of unipolar depressive disorder do not receive treatment as advised by national guidelines. Consequently, self-monitoring and self-management become increasingly important. New mobile technologies create unique opportunities to obtain and utilize patient-generated data. As common adherence rates to mobile technologies are scarce, a profound knowledge of user behavior and attitudes and preferences is important throughout any developmental process of mobile technologies and apps. Objective: The aim of this survey was to provide descriptive data upon usage and anticipated usage of self-monitoring and self-management of depression and preferences of potential users in terms of documented parameters and data-sharing options. Methods: A Web-based survey comprising 55 questions was conducted to obtain data on the usage of mobile devices, app usage, and participant’s attitudes and preferences toward mobile health apps for the self-monitoring and self-management of depression. Results: A total of 825 participants provided information. Moreover, two-thirds of the sample self-reported to be affected by depressive symptoms, but only 12.1\% (81/668) of those affected by depression have ever used any mobile self-monitoring or self-management app. Analysis showed that people want personally relevant information and feedback but also focus on handling sensitive data. Conclusions: New mobile technologies and smartphone apps, especially in combination with mobile sensor systems, offer unique opportunities to overcome challenges in the treatment of depression by utilizing the potential of patient-generated data. Focus on patient-relevant information, security and safe handling of sensitive personal data, as well as options to share data with self-selected third parties should be considered mandatory throughout any development process.},

A key issue in the analysis of such data is the separation of within-person and between-person effects. This problem is well studied for the effect of between-person effects, such as varying intercepts, on within-person parameters, such as cross-lagged effects. In this paper, we discuss a less appreciated effect of within-person correlations on correlations between person-wise means. Using simulations and an analytical derivation, we show how observed correlations between personwise means are a function of both population between-person correlations and within-person correlations. This has implications for the interpretation of statistical relationships between personwise means, for example when estimated directly from the data or within stepwise approaches to estimating multilevel vector autoregressive models, such as in the popular R package mlVAR.

  abstract = {Idiographic modeling is rapidly gaining popularity, promising to tap into the within-person dynamics underlying psychological phenomena. To gain theoretical understanding of these dynamics, we need to make inferences from time series models about the underlying system. Such inferences are subject to two challenges: time series models will arguably always be misspecified, meaning it is unclear how to make inferences to the underlying system; and second, the sampling frequency must be sufficient to capture the dynamics of interest. We discuss both problems with the following approach: we specify a toy model for emotion dynamics as the true system, generate time series data from it, and then try to recover that system with the most popular time series analysis tools. We show that making straightforward inferences from time series models about an underlying system is difficult. We also show that if the sampling frequency is insufficient, the dynamics of interest cannot be recovered. However, we also show that global characteristics of the system can be recovered reliably. We conclude by discussing the consequences of our findings for idiographic modeling and suggest a modeling methodology that goes beyond fitting time series models alone and puts formal theories at the center of theory development.},

  abstract = {Idiographic modeling is rapidly gaining popularity, promising to tap into the within-person dynamics underlying psychological phenomena. To gain theoretical understanding of these dynamics, we need to make inferences from time series models about the underlying system. Such inferences are subject to two challenges: first, time series models will arguably always be misspecified, meaning it is unclear how to make inferences to the underlying system; and second, the sampling frequency must be sufficient to capture the dynamics of interest. We discuss both problems with the following approach: we specify a toy model for emotion dynamics as the true system, generate time series data from it, and then try to recover that system with the most popular time series analysis tools. We show that making straightforward inferences from time series models about an underlying system is difficult. We also show that if the sampling frequency is insufficient, the dynamics of interest cannot be recovered. However, we also show that global characteristics of the system can be recovered reliably. We conclude by discussing the consequences of our findings for idiographic modeling and suggest a modeling methodology that goes beyond fitting time series models alone and puts formal theories at the center of theory development.},

  abstract = {Time series of individual subjects have become a common data type in psychological research. These data allow one to estimate models of within-subject dynamics, and thereby avoid the notorious problem of making within-subjects inferences from between-subjects data, and naturally address heterogeneity between subjects. A popular model for these data is the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, in which each variable is predicted by a linear function of all variables at previous time points. A key assumption of this model is that its parameters are constant (or stationary) across time. However, in many areas of psychological research time-varying parameters are plausible or even the subject of study. In this tutorial paper, we introduce methods to estimate time-varying VAR models based on splines and kernel-smoothing with/without regularization. We use simulations to evaluate the relative performance of all methods in scenarios typical in applied research, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we provide a step-by-step tutorial showing how to apply the discussed methods to an openly available time series of mood-related measurements.},

The aim of the current research was to experimentally manipulate aspects of an AA study’s assessment intensity—sampling frequency (Study 1) and questionnaire length (Study 2)—and to investigate their impact on perceived burden, compliance, within-person variability, and within-person relationships between time-varying variables. In Study 1, students (n = 313) received either 3 or 9 questionnaires per day for the first 7 days of the study. In Study 2, students (n = 282) received either a 33- or 82-item questionnaire three times a day for 14 days. Within-person variability and within-person relationships were investigated with respect to momentary pleasant-unpleasant mood and state extraversion. The results of Study 1 showed that a higher sampling frequency increased perceived burden but did not affect the other aspects we investigated. In Study 2, longer questionnaire length did not affect perceived burden or compliance but yielded a smaller degree of within-person variability in momentary mood (but not in state extraversion) and a smaller within-person relationship between state extraversion and mood. Differences between Studies 1 and 2 with respect to the type of manipulation of assessment intensity are discussed.},

  abstract = {As the number of studies using ambulatory assessment (AA) has been increasing across diverse fields of research, so has the necessity to identify potential threats to AA data quality such as careless responding. To date, careless responding has primarily been studied in crosssectional surveys. The goal of the present research was to identify latent profiles of momentary careless responding on the occasions level and latent classes of individuals (who differ in the distribution of careless responding profiles across occasions) on the person level using multilevel latent class analysis (ML-LCA). We discuss which of the previously proposed indices seem promising for investigating careless responding in AA studies, and we show how ML-LCA can be applied to model careless responding in intensive longitudinal data. We used data from an AA study in which the sampling frequency (3 vs. 9 occasions per day, 7 days, n = 310 participants) was experimentally manipulated. We tested the effect of sampling frequency on careless responding using multigroup ML-LCA and investigated situational and respondent-level covariates. The results showed that four Level 1 profiles (“careful”, “slow”, two types of “careless” responding) and four Level 2 classes (“careful”, “frequently careless”, two types of “infrequently careless” respondents) could be identified. Sampling frequency did not have an effect on careless responding. On the person (but not the occasion) level, motivational variables were associated with careless responding. We hope that researchers might find the application of an ML-LCA approach useful to shed more light on factors influencing careless responding in AA studies.},

They reveal that measurement in psychology mostly concerns the estimation of latent variables and compares unfavorably to the development of measurement in the history of physics. They, however, fail to include a comparison with the great advances in theory-based measurement achieved in modern physics. In this commentary, I describe how measurement is formalized in classical physics and examine what would be required to formalize the physical measurement of psychological phenomena. I conclude that, without an examination of the theoretical assumptions underlying current measurement procedures and a formal notion of psychological measurement, it is unlikely that psychological science will be able to generate the substantive theories suggested by Borgstede and Eggert.},

However, the methods and models developed to study complex dynamical systems have not been widely adopted, and it has recently been noted this may constitute a problem moving the field forward. In the present paper, I argue that an ontological commitment to complex adaptive systems is not only possible, but highly recommended for the study of resilience in development. Such a commitment, however, also comes with a commitment to a different causal ontology and different research methods. In the first part of the paper, I discuss the extent to which current research on resilience in development conceptually adheres to the complex systems perspective. In the second part, I introduce conceptual tools that may help researchers conceptualize causality in complex systems. The third part discusses idiographic methods that could be used in a research program that embraces the interaction dominant causal ontology and idiosyncratic nature of the dynamics of complex systems. The conclusion is that a strong ontological commitment is warranted, but will require a radical departure from nomothetic science.},

  abstract = {The threat to reproducibility and awareness of current rates of research misbehavior sparked initiatives to better academic science. One initiative is preregistration of quantitative research. We investigate whether the preregistration format could also be used to boost the credibility of qualitative research. A crucial distinction underlying preregistration is that between prediction and postdiction. In qualitative research, data are used to decide which way interpretation should move forward, using data to generate hypotheses and new research questions. Qualitative research is thus a real-life example of postdiction research. Some may object to the idea of preregistering qualitative studies because qualitative research generally does not test hypotheses, and because qualitative research design is typically flexible and subjective. We rebut these objections, arguing that making hypotheses explicit is just one feature of preregistration, that flexibility can be tracked using preregistration, and that preregistration would provide a check on subjectivity. We then contextualize preregistrations alongside another initiative to enhance credibility in qualitative research: the confirmability audit. Besides, preregistering qualitative studies is practically useful to combating dissemination bias and could incentivize qualitative researchers to report constantly on their study's development. We conclude with suggested modifications to the Open Science Framework preregistration form to tailor it for qualitative studies.},

However, given new technological developments, other potential sources can be considered to improve measurements. In a feasibility study, we examined whether Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) using digital phenotyping (stress level) can be a valuable tool to investigate change processes during cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Seven outpatients undergoing psychological treatment were assessed using EMA. Continuous stress levels (heart rate variability) were assessed via fitness trackers (Garmin) every 3 min over a 2-week time period (6,720 measurements per patient). Time-varying change point autoregressive (TVCP-AR) models were employed to detect both gradual and abrupt changes in stress levels. Results for seven case examples indicate differential patterns of change processes in stress. More precisely, inertia of stress level changed gradually over time in one of the participants, whereas the other participants showed both gradual and abrupt changes. This feasibility study demonstrates that intensive longitudinal assessments enriched by digitally assessed stress levels have the potential to investigate intra- and interindividual differences in treatment change processes and their relations to treatment outcome. Further, implementation issues and implications for future research and developments using digital phenotyping are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Visualisations and readily-accessible web-based supplementary files can improve data reporting and transparency. In this paper, we make use of recent developments in software and psychological network analysis to describe the baseline cohort of a trial testing the Let’s Move It intervention, which aimed to increase physical activity (PA) and reduce sedentary behaviours (SB) among vocational school students. Methods: At baseline, 1166 adolescents, distributed across 6 school clusters and four educational tracks, completed measures of PA and SB, theoretical predictors of these behaviours, and body composition. Within a comprehensive website supplement, which includes all code and analyses, data were tabulated and visualised, and network analyses explored relations between predictor variables and outcomes. Results: Average daily moderate-to-vigorous PA was 65 min (CI95: 57min–73 min), and SB 8h44 min (CI95: 8h04min–9h24 min), with 25.8 (CI95: 23.5–28.0) interruptions to sitting. Cluster randomisation appeared to result in balanced distributions for baseline characteristics between intervention and control groups, but differences emerged across the four educational tracks. Self-reported behaviour change technique (BCT) use was low for many but not all techniques. A network analysis revealed direct relationships between PA and behavioural experiments, planning and autonomous motivation, and several BCTs were connected to PA via autonomous motivation. Visualisation uncovered a case of Simpson’s paradox. Conclusions: Data-visualisation and data exploration techniques (e.g. network analysis) can help reveal the dynamics involved in complex multi-causal systems – a challenging task with traditional data presentations. The benefits of presenting complex data visually should encourage researchers to publish extensive analyses and descriptions as website supplements, which would increase the},

  abstract = {Background Exercise can relieve both depressive and anxiety disorders and it is therefore of importance to establish movement patterns of mildly to moderately affected sufferers to estimate the treatment potential. The aim is to describe the physical activity patterns of people affected by mild to moderate depressive and/or anxiety symptoms using objective measures of physical activity. Methods The design of the study was cross-sectional using data from 165 people aged 18–65 years, with mild to moderate depressive and/or anxiety disorder symptoms (scoring ≥10 on the PHQ-9). Diagnoses were made using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and symptom severity was measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The participants wore accelerometers for a week to evaluate physical activity patterns. Results No statistically significant differences were detected between different diagnoses, though depressed participants tended to be less active and more sedentary. Only one-fifth of the sample followed public health guidelines regarding physical activity. Each one point increase in MADRS was associated with a 2.4 minute reduction in light physical activity, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary time. MADRS was positively associated with number of sedentary bouts. Conclusions The physical activity pattern of people with depressive and/or anxiety disorders was characterized by large amounts of sedentary time and low fulfillment of physical activity guidelines. There is therefore a large treatment potential for this group by increasing exercise. The results suggest that instead of focusing exclusively on high intensity exercise for treating depressive and anxiety disorders, health care providers might encourage patients to reduce sedentary time by increasing light physical activity and decreasing the number of sedentary bouts, though further studies are needed that can determine directionality.},

We find that there is no day-of week effect for life evaluations, represented here by the Cantril Ladder, but significantly more happiness, enjoyment, and laughter, and significantly less anxiety, sadness, and anger on weekends (including public holidays) than on weekdays. We then find strong evidence of the importance of the social context, both at work and at home, in explaining the size and likely determinants of the weekend effects for emotions. Weekend effects are twice as large for full-time paid workers as for the rest of the population, and are much smaller for those whose work supervisor is considered a partner rather than a boss and who report trustable and open work environments. A large portion of the weekend effects is explained by differences in the amount of time spent with friends or family between weekends and weekdays (7.1 vs. 5.4~h). The extra daily social time of 1.7~h in weekends raises average happiness by about 2~\%.},

Whether athletes with a background or tendency to develop these issues are drawn to the sport, or whether it drives these higher incidences, is unknown. However, the biological drive of cyclical energy restriction may contribute to binge-eating behavior. Additionally, requisite monitoring, manipulation, comparison, and judgement of one\&rsquo;s physique may contribute to body image concerns. Contest preparation necessitates manipulating body composition through energy restriction and increased expenditure, requiring dietary restraint and nutrition, exercise, and physique assessment. Thus, competitors are at mental health risk due to (1) pre-existing or predispositions to develop body image or eating disorders; (2) biological effects of energy restriction on eating psychology; and (3) dietary restraint attitudes and resultant physique, exercise, and nutrition monitoring behavior. In our narrative review we cover each factor, concluding with tentative best-practice recommendations, including dietary flexibility, slower weight loss, structured monitoring, gradual returns to offseason energy intakes, internal eating cues, appropriate offseason body compositions, and support from nutrition and mental health professionals. A mental health focus is a needed paradigm shift in bodybuilding nutrition practice and research.},

But without comparison to simpler methods it can be difficult to determine when such complexity is required to obtain strong performance on a given problem. Here we evaluate the performance of an extremely simple classification approach—a linear classifier in the space of two simple features that ignore the sequential ordering of the data: the mean and standard deviation of time-series values. Across a large repository of 128 univariate time-series classification problems, this simple distributional moment-based approach outperformed chance on 69 problems, and reached 100\% accuracy on two problems. With a neuroimaging time-series case study, we find that a simple linear model based on the mean and standard deviation performs better at classifying individuals with schizophrenia than a model that additionally includes features of the time-series dynamics. Comparing the performance of simple distributional features of a time series provides important context for interpreting the performance of complex time-series classification models, which may not always be required to obtain high accuracy.},

  abstract = {In recent years, machine learning methods have become increasingly popular prediction methods in psychology. At the same time, psychological researchers are typically not only interested in making predictions about the dependent variable, but also in learning which predictor variables are relevant, how they influence the dependent variable, and which predictors interact with each other. However, most machine learning methods are not directly interpretable. Interpretation techniques that support researchers in describing how the machine learning technique came to its prediction may be a means to this end. We present a variety of interpretation techniques and illustrate the opportunities they provide for interpreting the results of two widely used black box machine learning methods that serve as our examples: random forests and neural networks. At the same time, we illustrate potential pitfalls and risks of misinterpretation that may occur in certain data settings. We show in which way correlated predictors impact interpretations with regard to the relevance or shape of predictor effects and in which situations interaction effects may or may not be detected. We use simulated didactic examples throughout the article, as well as an empirical data set for illustrating an approach to objectify the interpretation of visualizations. We conclude that, when critically reflected, interpretable machine learning techniques may provide useful tools when describing complex psychological relationships.

  abstract = {Connectivity modeling in functional neuroimaging has become widely used method of analysis for understanding functional architecture. One method for deriving directed connectivity models is Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME; ). GIMME looks for commonalities across the sample to detect signal from noise and arrive at edges that exist across the majority in the group (“group-level edges”) and individual-level edges. In this way, GIMME obtains generalizable results via the group-level edges while also allowing for between subject heterogeneity in connectivity, moving the field closer to obtaining reliable personalized connectivity maps. In this article, we present a novel extension of GIMME, confirmatory subgrouping GIMME, which estimates subgroup-level edges for a priori known groups (e.g. typically developing controls vs. clinical group). Detecting edges that consistently exist for individuals within predefined subgroups aids in interpretation of the heterogeneity in connectivity maps and allows for subgroup-specific inferences. We describe this algorithm, as well as several methods to examine the results. We present an empirical example that finds similarities and differences in resting state functional connectivity among four groups of children: typically developing controls (TDC), children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), children with Inattentive (ADHD-I) and Combined (ADHD-C) Type ADHD. Findings from this study suggest common involvement of the left Broca’s area in all the clinical groups, as well as several unique patterns of functional connectivity specific to a given disorder. Overall, the current approach and proof of principle findings highlight a novel and reliable tool for capturing heterogeneity in complex mental health disorders.},

Nevertheless, the different forms of non-stationarities associated with time series challenge the capabilities of data-driven ML models. Furthermore, due to the domain of forecasting being fostered mainly by statisticians and econometricians over the years, the concepts related to forecast evaluation are not the mainstream knowledge among ML researchers. We demonstrate in our work that as a consequence, ML researchers oftentimes adopt flawed evaluation practices which results in spurious conclusions suggesting methods that are not competitive in reality to be seemingly competitive. Therefore, in this work we provide a tutorial-like compilation of the details associated with forecast evaluation. This way, we intend to impart the information associated with forecast evaluation to fit the context of ML, as means of bridging the knowledge gap between traditional methods of forecasting and adopting current state-of-the-art ML techniques.We elaborate the details of the different problematic characteristics of time series such as non-normality and non-stationarities and how they are associated with common pitfalls in forecast evaluation. Best practices in forecast evaluation are outlined with respect to the different steps such as data partitioning, error calculation, statistical testing, and others. Further guidelines are also provided along selecting valid and suitable error measures depending on the specific characteristics of the dataset at hand.},

In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that (semi-) automatic RNN models are not silver bullets, but they are nevertheless competitive alternatives in many situations.},

  abstract = {Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) provides a flexible approach to fitting a variety of regression models while avoiding strong parametric assumptions. The sum-of-trees model is embedded in a Bayesian inferential framework to support uncertainty quantification and provide a principled approach to regularization through prior specification. This article presents the basic approach and discusses further development of the original algorithm that supports a variety of data structures and assumptions. We describe augmentations of the prior specification to accommodate higher dimensional data and smoother functions. Recent theoretical developments provide justifications for the performance observed in simulations and other settings. Use of BART in causal inference provides an additional avenue for extensions and applications. We discuss software options as well as challenges and future directions.},

  abstract = {Many statistical scenarios initially involve several candidate models that describe the data-generating process. Analysis often proceeds by first selecting the best model according to some criterion and then learning about the parameters of this selected model. Crucially, however, in this approach the parameter estimates are conditioned on the selected model, and any uncertainty about the model-selection process is ignored. An alternative is to learn the parameters for all candidate models and then combine the estimates according to the posterior probabilities of the associated models. This approach is known as Bayesian model averaging (BMA). BMA has several important advantages over all-or-none selection methods, but has been used only sparingly in the social sciences. In this conceptual introduction, we explain the principles of BMA, describe its advantages over all-or-none model selection, and showcase its utility in three examples: analysis of covariance, meta-analysis, and network analysis.},

  abstract = {The use of idiographic research techniques has gained popularity within psychological research and network analysis in particular. Idiographic research has been proposed as a promising avenue for future research, with differences between idiographic results highlighting evidence for radical heterogeneity. However, in the quest to address the individual in psychology, some classic statistical problems, such as those arising from sampling variation and power limitations, should not be overlooked. This article aims to determine to what extent current tools to compare idiographic networks are suited to disentangle true from illusory heterogeneity in the presence of sampling error. To this end, we investigate the performance of tools to inspect heterogeneity (visual inspection, comparison of centrality measures, investigating standard deviations of random effects, and GIMME) through simulations. Results show that power limitations hamper the validity of conclusions regarding heterogeneity and that the power required to assess heterogeneity adequately is often not realized in current research practice. Of the tools investigated, inspecting standard deviations of random effects and GIMME proved the most suited. However, all tools evaluated leave the door wide open to misinterpret all observed variability in terms of individual differences. Hence, the current paper calls for caution in the use and interpretation of new time-series techniques when it comes to heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {The comparison of idiographic network structures in order to determine the presence of heterogeneity is a challenging endeavor in many applied settings. Previously, researchers eyeballed idiographic networks, computed correlations between idiographic networks, as well as used techniques that make use of the multilevel structure of the data (e.g., GIMME and mlVAR) to investigate individual differences. However, these methods do not allow for testing the equality of idiographic network structures directly. In this paper, we propose the Individual Network Invariance Test (INIT). INIT extends common model comparison practices in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to idiographic network structures to test for (in)equality between idiographic network structures. In a simulation study, we evaluated the performance of INIT on both saturated and pruned idiographic network structures by inspecting the rejection rate of the χ2 difference test and of model selection criteria such as the AIC and BIC. Results show INIT performs adequately when 100 or more data points are available per individual. When applying INIT on saturated networks, AIC performed best as a model selection criteria, while BIC showed better results when applying INIT on pruned networks. In an empirical example, we highlight the possibilities of this new technique, illustrating how INIT provides researchers with a means of testing for (in)equality between idiographic network structures, and within idiographic network structures over time. To conclude, recommendations for empirical researchers are provided.},

With examples from clinical psychology, we show how qualitative approaches can inform on the necessity and feasibility of quantitative analysis and may yet sometimes approximate causal answers.Results: Qualitative use is hidden in some quantitative methods. For instance, it may yet suffice to know the direction of bias for a tentative causal conclusion. Counterfactuals clarify what causal effects of changeable factors are, unravel what is required for a causal answer, but do not cover immutable causes like gender. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) address causal effects in a broader sense, may give rise to quantitative estimation or indicate that this is premature.Conclusion: No method is generally sufficient or necessary. Any causal analysis must ground on qualification and should balance the harms of a false positive and a false negative conclusion in a specific context.},

An alternative to the latent disease model is the complex network approach. Instead of assuming that symptoms arise from an underlying disease entity, the complex network approach holds that disorders exist as systems of interrelated elements of a network. This approach also provides a framework for the understanding of therapeutic change. Depending on the structure of the network, change can occur abruptly once the network reaches a critical threshold (the tipping point). Homogeneous and highly connected networks often recover more slowly from local perturbations when the network approaches the tipping point, potentially making it possible to predict treatment change, relapse, and recovery. In this article, we discuss the complex network approach as an alternative to the latent disease model and its implications for classification, therapy, relapse, and recovery.},

This could represent a paradigm shift in clinical science with far-reaching implications. Clinical science might see a decline of named therapies defined by set technologies, a decline of broad schools, a rise of testable models, a rise of mediation and moderation studies, the emergence of new forms of diagnosis based on functional analysis, a move from nomothetic to idiographic approaches, and a move toward processes that specify modifiable elements.

Methods : The study used ecological momentary assessment to associate mood, measured via text messaging twice daily for five days, using a 10-point Likert scale, with objectively measured physical activity (accelerometer data) in people with moderate-to-severe depression. Multilevel regression models were used to explore the relationship between physical activity undertaken at different intensities over the previous one and three hours, and subsequent affect score. A total of 388 paired data points were collected from 43 participants. Results : There was no association between minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity in the previous hour and subsequent affect score (which we had hypothesised). However, exploratory analyses found a significant relationship between affect and combined physical activity in the previous hour (β1 coefficient~=~0.023, p~=~0.037). Limitations : Periods of moderate-vigorous activity were infrequent, reducing the statistical power for analysing associations with this intensity of activity. Only one dimension of mood was sampled. Conclusions : The data suggest that, in people with moderate-to-severe depression, time spent engaging in any intensity of physical activity was significantly associated with subsequent mood. Further research is needed to more clearly define the dynamics of the relationship between physical activity and low mood. This will aid identification of optimal prescription criteria for physical activity in people with depression.},

  abstract = {A popular goal in psychological science is to understand human cognition and behavior in the ‘real-world.’ In contrast, researchers have typically conducted their research in experimental research settings, a.k.a. the ‘psychologist’s laboratory.’ Critics have often questioned whether psychology’s laboratory experiments permit generalizable results. This is known as the ‘real-world or the lab’-dilemma. To bridge the gap between lab and life, many researchers have called for experiments with more ‘ecological validity’ to ensure that experiments more closely resemble and generalize to the ‘real-world.’ However, researchers seldom explain what they mean with this term, nor how more ecological validity should be achieved. In our opinion, the popular concept of ecological validity is ill-formed, lacks specificity, and falls short of addressing the problem of generalizability. To move beyond the ‘real-world or the lab’-dilemma, we believe that researchers in psychological science should always specify the particular context of cognitive and behavioral functioning in which they are interested, instead of advocating that experiments should be more ‘ecologically valid’ in order to generalize to the ‘real-world.’ We believe this will be a more constructive way to uncover the context-specific and context-generic principles of cognition and behavior.},

  abstract = {Background The identification of potential high-risk groups for depression is of importance. The purpose of the present study was to identify high-risk profiles for depressive symptoms in older individuals, with a focus on functional performance. Methods The population-based Healthy Ageing Initiative included 2,084 community-dwelling individuals (49\% women) aged 70. Explorative cluster analysis was used to group participants according to functional performance level, using measures of basic mobility skills, gait variability, and grip strength. Intercluster differences in depressive symptoms (measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS]-15), physical activity (PA; measured objectively with the ActiGraph GT3X+), and a rich set of covariates were examined. Results The cluster analysis yielded a seven-cluster solution. One potential high-risk cluster was identified, with overrepresentation of individuals with GDS scores {$>$}5 (15.1 vs. 2.7\% expected; relative risk = 6.99, P {$<$} .001); the prevalence of depressive symptoms was significantly lower in the other clusters (all P {$<$} .01). The potential high-risk cluster had significant overrepresentations of obese individuals (39.7 vs. 17.4\% expected) and those with type 2 diabetes (24.7 vs. 8.5\% expected), and underrepresentation of individuals who fulfilled the World Health Organization's PA recommendations (15.6 vs. 59.1\% expected; all P {$<$} .01), as well as low levels of functional performance. Conclusions The present study provided a potential high-risk profile for depressive symptoms among elderly community-dwelling individuals, which included low levels functional performance combined with low levels of PA. Including PA in medical screening of the elderly may aid in identification of potential high-risk individuals for depressive symptoms.},

Actigraphy, a non-invasive method for monitoring motor activity, can be used to objectively assess circadian rest-activity rhythms and sleep patterns. While recent studies have measured sleep and daytime activity of depressed patients using wrist-worn actigraphy, the actigraphic 24-h~rest-activity rhythm in depression has not been well documented. We aimed to examine actigraphically measured sleep and circadian rest-activity rhythms in depressed outpatients. Twenty patients with DSM-IV major depressive episode and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls participated in this study. Participants completed 7 consecutive days of all-day actigraphic activity monitoring while engaging in usual activities. For sleep parameters, total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, and sleep fragmentation index were determined. Circadian rhythms were estimated by fitting individual actigraphy data to a cosine curve of a 24-h~activity rhythm using the cosinor method, which generated three circadian activity rhythm parameters, i.e., MESOR (rhythm-adjusted mean), amplitude, and acrophase. Subjective sleep was also assessed using a sleep diary and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Patients showed significantly lower MESOR and more dampened amplitude along with significant sleep disturbances. Logistic regression analysis revealed that lower MESOR and more fragmented sleep emerged as the significant predictors of depression. Correlations between subjectively and actigraphically measured parameters demonstrated the validity of actigraphic measurements. These results indicate marked disturbances in sleep and circadian rest-activity rhythms of depression. By simultaneously measuring sleep and rest-activity rhythm parameters, actigraphy might serve as an objective diagnostic aid for depression.},

  abstract = {One of the most common inflammatory markers examined in depression is C-reactive protein (CRP). However, the magnitude of the association between CRP and depression when controlling for potentially confounding factors such as age, sex, socio-economic status, body mass index, medication and other substance use, and medical illness, is unclear. Inconsistencies in other methodological practices, such as sample collection, assaying, and data cleaning and transformation, may contribute to variations in results. We aggregate studies that examined the association between CRP and depression in two ways. First, a systematic review summarizes how studies of CRP and depression have reported on methodological issues. Second, a tiered meta-analysis aggregates studies that have adhered to various levels of methodological rigor. Findings from the systematic review indicate a lack of protocol detail provided. The effect between depression and CRP was small, but highly significant across all stages of the meta-analysis (p\,{$<$}\,0.01). The effect size in the most methodologically rigorous stage of the meta-analysis, which included studies controlling for age, sex, obesity, medical conditions and substance, medication, or psychosocial factors, was small (r\,=\,0.05). There were also only 26 articles in this stage (13\% of studies from the systematic review), suggesting that more studies that consistently account for these confounding factors are needed. Additionally, an a priori quality score of methodological rigor was a significant moderator in this stage of the meta-analysis. The effect size was strikingly attenuated (r\,=\,0.005) and non-significant in studies with higher quality scores. We describe a set of recommended guidelines for future research to consider, including sample collection and assaying procedures, data cleaning and statistical methods, and control variables to assess.},

  abstract = {Mental health care is built around patient recall and report of clinical symptoms. However, memories of events and experiences rely on cognitive heuristics that influence our recall. The peak-end bias, which refers to the tendency for the most intense and proximate aspects of an experience to disproportionately influence our memory, has been understudied in the context of mental health symptoms and may unduly influence self-reported symptoms, even in the context of standardized assessments. To determine whether the peak-end bias applies to the report of depressive symptoms on the standardized Patient Health Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9) assessment, we compared two scores from daily mood assessments collected over a 2-week period from 4,322 medical interns (56\% women; 60\% non-Hispanic White). The peak-end-mood score, which averaged the single lowest and most recent mood scores over 2 weeks had a significantly stronger correlation with the PHQ-9 than the mean-mood score, which averaged all mood scores during the 2 weeks. Likelihood ratio tests and fit statistics provided further support that the peak-end-mood score was a significantly better predictor of depression than the mean-mood score. Results were consistent when limiting the sample to those with mild-to-severe depressive symptoms, and when only examining the two primary mood items as the dependent variable. These findings provide evidence for a modest peak-end recall bias for mood and depressive symptoms. There may be benefits to implementing intermittent assessment strategies to support clinical decision-making. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

Epskamp, Borsboom, \& Fried, 2018; Fisher, Medaglia, \& Jeronimus, 2018). Rather than examine the correlational relationships between variables in a sample of individuals, an idiographic network examines correlations within a single person, averaged over many time points. Because the approach averages over time, the data must be stationary (i.e. relatively consistent over time). If individuals experience varying states over time—different mixtures of symptoms and behaviours in one moment or another—then averaging over categorically different moments may undermine model accuracy. Fisher and Bosley (2019) address these concerns via the application of Gaussian finite mixture modelling to identify latent classes of time points in intraindividual time-series data from a sample of adults with major depressive disorder and/or generalised anxiety disorder (n = 45). The present paper outlines an extension of this work, wherein network analysis is used to model within-class covariation of symptoms. To illustrate this approach, network models were constructed for each intraindividual class identified by Fisher and Bosley (137 networks across the 45 participants, mean classes/person = 3, range = 2–4 classes/person). We examine the relative consistency in symptom organisation between each individual's multiple mood state networks and assess emergent group-level patterns. We highlight opportunities for enhanced treatment personalisation and review nomothetic patterns relevant to transdiagnostic conceptualisations of psychopathology. We address opportunities for integrating this approach into clinical practice and outline potential shortcomings.},

Sleep disturbance is frequently reported by those with lifetime depression, however whether circadian misalignment also exists is unclear. We aimed to examine circadian rhythms and sleep associations in older patients with and without lifetime depression. Methods: Thirty-four older people meeting DSM-IV criteria for lifetime major depression (mean age = 63.9 years), and 30 healthy controls (mean age = 65.7 years) were recruited. Participants underwent 2-weeks of actigraphy followed by a 3-night protocol including dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) assessment and overnight polysomnography (PSG) for sleep architecture. DLMO and phase angle of entrainment were computed. Results: Compared to controls, participants with depression had a significantly longer phase angle of entrainment (6.82 h ± 1.45 vs. 5.87 h ± 1.60, p = 0.02, Cohens-d = 0.62). A small to moderate yet non-significant difference in DLMO times, with earlier DLMO (34 ± 27 min) observed in depression (20:36 ± 1:48 vs. 21:10 ± 1:48, p = 0.22, Cohens-d = 0.32). Individuals with depression had longer sleep latency and latency to rapid eye movement sleep than controls (all p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusion: Circadian advancement and alterations to the timing of sleep and REM onset are evident in older people with lifetime major depression, despite having only mild residual symptoms. Further research examining the prognostic significance of these changes is warranted as well as chronotherapeutic treatment studies.},

  abstract = {The issue of model uncertainty has been gaining interest in education and the social sciences community over the years, and the dominant methods for handling model uncertainty are based on Bayesian inference, and particularly, Bayesian model averaging. However, Bayesian model averaging seeks a single best model which assumes that the true generating model is in the model space. Unlike Bayesian model averaging, the method of Bayesian stacking can account for model uncertainty without assuming that a true model exists. An issue with Bayesian stacking, however, is that it is an optimization technique that uses input-independent model weights and is, therefore, not fully Bayesian. Bayesian hierarchical stacking, proposed by Yao, Pirš, Vehtari, and Gelman (2021), further incorporates uncertainty by applying a hyperprior to the stacking weights. Considering the importance of multilevel models commonly applied in educational settings, this paper investigates the predictive performance of original Bayesian stacking and Bayesian hierarchical stacking along with two other readily available methods based on Bayesian model averaging weighting via a simulation study and a real data example from PISA 2018. Predictive performance is measured by the log predictive density and the Kullback-Leibler divergence scores. Results suggest that Bayesian hierarchical stacking performs consistently better than original Bayesian stacking and other BMA-based weighting systems in terms of predictive performance in multilevel models.},

Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between ±1.},

  abstract = {Background:  The vast majority of people worldwide have been impacted by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In addition to the millions of individuals who have been infected with the disease, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggests that this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes; however, researchers are rarely able to track these changes with frequent, near-real-time sampling or compare their findings to previous years of data for the same individuals.  Objective:  By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students who have been participating in a longitudinal study for the past 2 years, we sought to answer two overarching questions. First, have the behaviors and mental health of the participants changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous time periods? Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media?  Methods:  Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0\%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models.  Results:  During the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms ( P \&lt;.001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19–related news. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety ( P \&lt;.001) and depression ( P =.03) were significantly associated with COVID-19–related news.  Conclusions:  Compared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.

In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic.

RSA involves the estimation of a nonlinear polynomial regression model and the interpretation of the resulting response surface. However, little is known about how best to conduct RSA when the underlying data are incomplete. In this article, we compare different methods for handling missing data in RSA. This includes different strategies for multiple imputation (MI) and maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation. Specifically, we consider the “just another variable” (JAV) approach to MI and ML, an approach that is in regular use in applications of RSA, and the more novel “substantive-model-compatible” (SMC) approach. In a simulation study, we evaluate the impact of these methods on focal outcomes of RSA, including the accuracy of parameter estimates, the shape of the response surface, and the testing of congruence hypotheses. Our findings suggest that the JAV approach can sometimes distort parameter estimates and conclusions about the shape of the response surface, whereas the SMC approach performs well overall. We illustrate applications of the methods in a worked example with real data and provide recommendations for their application in practice.},

  abstract = {With the advent of new data collection technologies, intensive longitudinal data (ILD) are collected more frequently than ever. Along with the increased prevalence of ILD, more methods are being developed to analyze these data. However, relatively few methods have yet been applied for making long- or even short-term predictions from ILD in behavioral settings. Applications of forecasting methods to behavioral ILD are still scant. We first establish a general framework for modeling ILD and then extend that frame to two previously existing forecasting methods: these methods are Kalman prediction and ensemble prediction. After implementing Kalman and ensemble forecasts in free and open-source software, we apply these methods to daily drug and alcohol use data. In doing so, we create a simple, but nonlinear dynamical system model of daily drug and alcohol use and illustrate important differences between the forecasting methods. We further compare the Kalman and ensemble forecasting methods to several simpler forecasts of daily drug and alcohol use. Ensemble forecasts may be more appropriate than Kalman forecasts for nonlinear dynamical systems models, but further forecasting evaluation methods must be put into practice.},

  abstract = {Background Previous studies have shown that individual differences in affect dynamics during depressed patients’ everyday lives allow the prediction of treatment outcome and of symptom reoccurrence in remitted patients. In this study, we analyze whether understanding patients’ affective states and their fluctuation patterns helps predict early treatment response (until session 5). Methods Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) strategies allow in-depth analyses of real-time affective states and of their dynamics. Repeated assessments were made four times a day during a two-week period to capture real-life affective states (positive affect, PA and negative affect, NA) and dynamics (fluctuations in NA and PA) before the start of outpatient treatment of 39 patients. Due to the nested structure of the data, hierarchical linear models were conducted. Results PA/NA ratios, as well as fluctuations in NA predicted early treatment response, even when adjusting for initial impairment. In contrast, mean levels of NA or PA, as well as fluctuations in PA did not predict treatment response. Limitations The time between the EMA assessment and treatment onset varied between patients. However, this variation was not associated with early change. Conclusions The results suggest that pre-treatment affect dynamics could provide valuable information for predicting treatment response independent of initial impairment levels. Better predictions of early treatment response help to improve treatment choices early in the treatment progress.},

  abstract = {Network psychometrics is a new direction in psychological research that conceptualizes multivariate data as interacting systems. Variables are represented as nodes and their interactions yield (partial) associations. Current estimation methods mostly use a frequentist approach, which does not allow for proper uncertainty quantification of the model and its parameters. Here, we outline a Bayesian approach to network analysis that offers three main benefits. In particular, applied researchers can use Bayesian methods to (1) determine structure uncertainty, (2) obtain evidence for edge inclusion and exclusion (i.e., distinguish conditional (in)dependence between variables), and (3) quantify parameter precision. The paper provides a conceptual introduction to Bayesian inference and describes how researchers can facilitate the three benefits for networks. Furthermore, we review the available R packages for the Bayesian analysis of networks and introduce a new implementation in the open-source, user-friendly software JASP. The methodology is illustrated with a worked-out example of a network of personality traits and mental health.},

  abstract = {In this article, we propose integrated generalized structured component analysis (IGSCA), which is a general statistical approach for analyzing data with both components and factors in the same model, simultaneously. This approach combines generalized structured component analysis (GSCA) and generalized structured component analysis with measurement errors incorporated (GSCAM) in a unified manner and can estimate both factor- and component-model parameters, including component and factor loadings, component and factor path coefficients, and path coefficients connecting factors and components. We conduct 2 simulation studies to investigate the performance of IGSCA under models with both factors and components. The first simulation study assesses how existing approaches for structural equation modeling and IGSCA recover parameters. This study shows that only consistent partial least squares (PLSc) and IGSCA yield unbiased estimates of all parameters, whereas the other approaches always provided biased estimates of several parameters. As such, we conduct a second, extensive simulation study to evaluate the relative performance of the 2 competitors (PLSc and IGSCA), considering a variety of experimental factors (model specification, sample size, the number of indicators per factor/component, and exogenous factor/component correlation). IGSCA exhibits better performance than PLSc under most conditions. We also present a real data application of IGSCA to the study of genes and their influence on depression. Finally, we discuss the implications and limitations of this approach, and recommendations for future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Further, we assessed the relationship between adult attachment dimensions and these group processes. Women (n = 264) diagnosed with an eating disorder completed attachment scales pre-treatment, eating disorder symptom scales pre- and post-treatment, and group climate scales weekly during treatment. Treatment consisted of a specialized eating disorders group-based day hospital program with rolling admissions. Engaged group climate increased and Avoidance group climate decreased across weeks of treatment. Engaged group climate growth was associated with improved eating disorder symptoms post-treatment. Higher attachment avoidance at pre-treatment was related to lower Engaged group climate at week 1, and was related to a greater impact of the group on the individual's experience of group engagement. Clinicians might improve group processes and outcomes by tailoring interventions to individuals' attachment avoidance when treating women for eating disorders.},

  abstract = {Major depression occurs at high prevalence in the general population, often starts in juvenile years, recurs over a lifetime, and is strongly associated with disability and suicide. Searches for biological markers in depression may have been hindered by assuming that depression is a unitary and relatively homogeneous disorder, mainly of mood, rather than addressing particular, clinically crucial features or diagnostic subtypes. Many studies have implicated quantitative alterations of motility rhythms in depressed human subjects. Since a candidate feature of great public-health significance is the unusually high risk of suicidal behavior in depressive disorders, we studied correlations between a measure (vulnerability index [VI]) derived from multi-scale characteristics of daily-motility rhythms in depressed subjects (n = 36) monitored with noninvasive, wrist-worn, electronic actigraphs and their self-assessed level of suicidal thinking operationalized as a wish to die. Patient-subjects had a stable clinical diagnosis of bipolar-I, bipolar-II, or unipolar major depression (n = 12 of each type). VI was associated inversely with suicidal thinking (r = –0.61 with all subjects and r = –0.73 with bipolar disorder subjects; both p{$<$}0.0001) and distinguished patients with bipolar versus unipolar major depression with a sensitivity of 91.7\% and a specificity of 79.2\%. VI may be a useful biomarker of characteristic features of major depression, contribute to differentiating bipolar and unipolar depression, and help to detect risk of suicide. An objective biomarker of suicide-risk could be advantageous when patients are unwilling or unable to share suicidal thinking with clinicians.},

In neuroscience for example, co-registration complements and overcomes some of the shortcomings of individual methods. However, precise synchronization of the different data streams involved is required before joint data analysis. Our article presents and evaluates a synchronization method which maximizes the alignment of information across time. Synchronization through common triggers is widely used in all existing methods, because it is very simple and effective. However, this solution has been found to fail in certain practical situations, namely for the spurious detection of triggers and/or when the timestamps of triggers sampled by each acquisition device are not jointly distributed linearly for the entire duration of an experiment. We propose two additional mechanisms, the "Longest Common Subsequence" algorithm and a piecewise linear regression, in order to overcome the limitations of the classical method of synchronizing common triggers. The proposed synchronization method was evaluated using both real and artificial data. Co-registrations of electroencephalographic signals (EEG) and eye movements were used for real data. We compared the effectiveness of our method to another open source method implemented using EYE-EEG toolbox. Overall, we show that our method, implemented in C++ as a DOS application, is very fast, robust and fully automatic.},

  abstract = {The Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) has recently grown popular in psychological research, with a large body of estimation methods being proposed and discussed across various fields of study, and several algorithms being identified and recommend as applicable to psychological datasets. Such high-dimensional model estimation, however, is not trivial, and algorithms tend to perform differently in different settings. In addition, psychological research poses unique challenges, including placing a strong focus on weak edges (e.g., bridge edges), handling data measured on ordered scales, and relatively limited sample sizes. As a result, there is currently no consensus regarding which estimation procedure performs best in which setting. In this large-scale simulation study, we aimed to overcome this gap in the literature by comparing the performance of several estimation algorithms suitable for gaussian and skewed ordered categorical data across a multitude of settings, as to arrive at concrete guidelines from applied researchers. In total, we investigated 60 different metrics across 564,000 simulated datasets. We summarized our findings through a platform that allows for manually exploring simulation results. Overall, we found that an exchange between discovery (e.g., sensitivity, edge weight correlation) and caution (e.g., specificity, precision) should always be expected and achieving both¬—which is a requirement for perfect replicability—is difficult. Further, we identified that the estimation method is best chosen in light of each research question and highlighted, alongside desirable asymptotic properties and low sample size discovery, results according to most common research questions in the field.},

Data from an empirical ecological momentary assessment study are then used to demonstrate the utility of the proposed tool in identifying the optimal time lag for studying the linkages between nervousness and heart rate in a group of undergraduate students. Using a simulation study, we illustrate the effectiveness of DTVEM in identifying optimal lag structures in multiple-subject time-series data with missingness, as well as its strengths and limitations as a hybrid exploratory–confirmatory approach, relative to other existing approaches.},

Nevertheless, very little research has examined predicting depressed mood within a day, which is essential given the large amount of variation occurring within days. The current study utilized passively collected sensor data collected from a smartphone application to future depressed mood from hour-to-hour in an ecological momentary assessment study in a sample reporting clinical levels of depression (N = 31). Using a combination of nomothetic and idiographically-weighted machine learning models, the results suggest that depressed mood can be accurately predicted from hour to hour with an average correlation between out of sample predicted depressed mood levels and observed depressed mood of 0.587, CI [0.552, 0.621]. This suggests that passively collected smartphone data can accurately predict future depressed mood among a sample reporting clinical levels of depression. If replicated in other samples, this modeling framework may allow just-in-time adaptive interventions to treat depression as it changes in the context of daily life.},

The current study examined the use of passive movement and light data from wearable devices to assess depression severity in 15 patients with MDD. Using over 1 week of movement data, we were able to significantly assess depression severity with high precision for self-reported (r = 0.855; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.610–0.950; p = 4.95 × 10−5) and clinician-rated (r = 0.604; 95\% CI, 0.133–0.894; p = 0.017) symptom severity.

  abstract = {Machine learning (i.e., data mining, artificial intelligence, big data) has been increasingly applied in psychological science. Although some areas of research have benefited tremendously from a new set of statistical tools, most often in the use of biological or genetic variables, the hype has not been substantiated in more traditional areas of research. We argue that this phenomenon results from measurement errors that prevent machine-learning algorithms from accurately modeling nonlinear relationships, if indeed they exist. This shortcoming is showcased across a set of simulated examples, demonstrating that model selection between a machine-learning algorithm and regression depends on the measurement quality, regardless of sample size. We conclude with a set of recommendations and a discussion of ways to better integrate machine learning with statistics as traditionally practiced in psychological science.},

Numerous publications published in the last five years have proposed diverse sets of objective loss functions to address cases such as biased data, long-term forecasting, multicollinear features, etc. In this paper, we have summarized 14 well-known regression loss functions commonly used for time series forecasting and listed out the circumstances where their application can aid in faster and better model convergence. We have also demonstrated how certain categories of loss functions perform well across all data sets and can be considered as a baseline objective function in circumstances where the distribution of the data is unknown.

  abstract = {Temporal instability of affect is a defining characteristic of psychological disorders such as borderline personality disorder (BPD) and mood cycling disorders. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) enables researchers to directly assess such frequent and extreme fluctuations over time. The authors examined 4 operationalizations of such temporal instability: the within-person variance (WPV), the first-order autocorrelation, the mean square successive difference (MSSD), and the probability of acute change (PAC). It is argued that the MSSD and PAC measures are preferred indices of affective instability because they capture both variability and temporal dependency in a time series. Additionally, the performance of these 2 measures in capturing within- and between-day instability is discussed. To illustrate, the authors present EMA data from a study of negative mood in BPD and major depressive disorder patients. In this study, MSSD and PAC captured affective instability better than did WPV. Given that MSSD and PAC are individual difference measures, the authors propose that group differences on these indices be explored using generalized multilevel models. Versions of MSSD and PAC that adjust for randomly elapsed time interval between assessments are also presented.},

  abstract = {Symptom fluctuation is one of the hallmarks of major depression. However, a principled, quantitative framework explaining when and how symptoms change remains elusive. Following a complex systems perspective, we model clusters of depressive symptomatology across N = 2059 longitudinal biweekly measurements using a mobile phone app from N = 113 patients based on Beck Depression Inventory-I (BDI-I). We show that 1) the five largest clusters cover more than 60\% of all symptom profiles, 2) in close to 90\% of all cases, major temporal fluctuations in depression scores (i.e. sum of BDI-I items) coincides temporally with the change between the symptom clusters, 3) the probability of an approaching transition increases the further away the symptoms move from the center of the clusters (r = 0.78, p {$<$} 0.008), and 4) the approaching symptoms clusters are those that are closest to the BDI measurement at any given moment (r = 0.42, p {$<$} 0.0001). Taken together these results support the notion that symptom fluctuations can be predicted with high precision, potentially opening the possibility to augment interventions by predicting upcoming shifts in symptom structures.},

This prevalence is even more remarkable given the dominance of other methods in the literature and the M4 competition. This article tries to explain why tree-based methods were so widely used in the M5 competition. We see possibilities for future improvements of tree-based models and then distill some learnings for other approaches, including but not limited to neural networks.},

  abstract = {With the emerging ubiquity of cell phones, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) as a set of methods enable researchers to study momentary social, psychological, and affective responses to everyday life. Additionally, EMA enables researchers to acquire longitudinal data without the need for multiple lab visits. As the use of EMA in research increases, so too does the necessity of determining what constitutes valid or careless individual EMA responses to ensure validity and replicability of findings. Currently, EMA studies solely consider the response rate of a participant for exclusion. Yet, other features of an assessment can help to determine whether a response is careless or implausible. Here, we examined over 18,000 EMA text message responses of individual affect items to derive a data-driven model of what constitutes a 'careless response.' Results from this study indicate that an overly fast time to complete items (≤ 1 s), an overly narrow within assessment response variance (SD ≤ 5), and the percentage of items that fall at the mode (≥ 60\%) are independent and reliable indicators of a careless response. Excluding careless responses such as these remove implausible positive correlations among psychometric antonyms (e.g., relaxed and anxious). Further, by identifying and removing careless responses, we also identify careless responders, participants who could be removed from group analyses. We use these results to develop and introduce an R package, EMAeval, so EMA researchers may similarly identify careless responses and responders either online during data collection or posthoc, after data collection has completed.

However, psychological researchers may be relatively unequipped to analyze such data, given its many characteristics and the general complexities involved in longitudinal modeling. The current paper introduces time series analysis to psychological research, an analytic domain that has been essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of variables across many diverse fields. First, the characteristics of time series data are discussed. Second, different time series modeling techniques are surveyed that can address various topics of interest to psychological researchers, including describing the pattern of change in a variable, modeling seasonal effects, assessing the immediate and long-term impact of a salient event, and forecasting future values. To illustrate these methods, an illustrative example based on online job search behavior is used throughout the paper, and a software tutorial in R for these analyses is provided in the Appendix.},

Human observers rated the similarity of pairs of images within four categories of stimuli—inanimate objects, animals, indoor scenes and outdoor scenes—via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We performed multidimensional scaling (MDS) on the collected similarity ratings to visualize the perceived similarity for each image category, for both visual and semantic ratings. The MDS solutions revealed the expected similarity relationships between images within each category, along with intuitively sensible differences between visual and semantic similarity relationships for each category. Stress tests performed on the MDS solutions indicated that the MDS analyses captured meaningful levels of variance in the similarity data. These stimuli, associated norms and naming data are made available~to all researchers, and should provide a useful resource for researchers of vision, memory and conceptual knowledge wishing to run experiments using well-parameterized stimulus sets.},

  abstract = {In structural equation modeling, several corrections to the likelihood-ratio model test statistic have been developed to counter the effects of non-normal data. Previous robustness studies investigating the performance of these corrections typically induced non-normality in the indicator variables. However, non-normality in the indicators can originate from non-normal errors or non-normal latent factors. We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the effect of non-normality in factors and errors on six different test statistics based on maximum likelihood estimation by evaluating the effect on empirical rejection rates and derived indices (RMSEA and CFI) for different degrees of non-normality and sample sizes. We considered the uncorrected likelihood-ratio model test statistic and the Satorra–Bentler scaled test statistic with Bartlett correction, as well as the mean and variance adjusted test statistic, a scale-shifted approach, a third moment-adjusted test statistic, and an approach drawing inferences from the relevant asymptotic chi-square mixture distribution. The results indicate that the values of the uncorrected test statistic—compared to values under normality—are associated with a severely inflated type I error rate when latent variables are non-normal, but virtually no differences occur when errors are non-normal. Although no general pattern regarding the source of non-normality for all analyzed measures of fit can be derived, the Satorra–Bentler scaled test statistic with Bartlett correction performed satisfactorily across conditions.},

  abstract = {Background and aims Psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDT) is an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), but not all clients with MDD can receive psychotherapy. Using the Internet to provide psychodynamic treatments is one way of improving access to psychological treatments for MDD. The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to investigate the efficacy of an Internet-based psychodynamic guided self-help treatment for MDD. Methods Ninety-two participants who were diagnosed with MDD according to the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview were randomised to treatment or an active control. The treatment consisted of nine treatment modules based on psychodynamic principles with online therapist contact. The active control condition was a structured support intervention and contained psychoeducation and scheduled weekly contacts online. Both interventions lasted for 10 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Results Mixed-effects model analyses of all randomised participants showed that participants receiving Internet-based PDT made large and superior improvements compared with the active control group on the BDI-II (between-group Cohen's d = 1.11). Treatment effects were maintained at a 10-month follow-up. Conclusions Internet-based psychodynamic guided self-help is an efficacious treatment for MDD that has the potential to increase accessibility and availability of PDT for MDD.

  abstract = {In the network approach to psychopathology, psychological constructs are conceptualized as networks of interacting components (e.g., the symptoms of a disorder). In this network view, interest is on the degree to which symptoms influence each other, both directly and indirectly. These direct and indirect influences are often captured with centrality indices, however, the estimation method often used with these networks, the frequentist graphical LASSO (GLASSO), has difficulty estimating (uncertainty in) these measures. Bayesian estimation might provide a solution, as it is better suited to deal with bias in the sampling distribution of centrality indices. This study therefore compares estimation of symptom networks with Bayesian GLASSO- and Horseshoe priors to estimation using the frequentist GLASSO using extensive simulations. Results showed that the Bayesian GLASSO performed better than the Horseshoe, and that the Bayesian GLASSO outperformed the frequentist GLASSO with respect to bias in edge weights, centrality measures, correlation between estimated and true partial correlations, and specificity. Sensitivity was better for the frequentist GLASSO, but performance of the Bayesian GLASSO is usually close. With respect to uncertainty in the centrality measures, the Bayesian GLASSO shows good coverage for strength and closeness centrality, but uncertainty in betweenness centrality is estimated less well.},

Methods We provide a survey of statistical and methodological issues involved in temporal network analysis, providing a description of available estimation tools and applications for conducting such analyses. Further, we provide supplemental R code and discuss simulations examining temporal networks that vary in sample size, number of variables, and number of time points. Results The following packages and software are reviewed: graphicalVAR, mlVAR, gimme, SparseTSCGM, mgm, psychonetrics, and the Mplus dynamic structural equation modeling module. We discuss the utility each procedure has for specific design considerations. Conclusion We conclude with notes on resources for estimating these models, emphasizing how temporal networks best approximate network theory.},

However, despite the feeling of innovation, it has also become clear that positive psychology has had a much longer past and has not fully acknowledged the salutogenic paradigm of Antonovsky. In this chapter, however, we attempt to reflect on the conceptualisation of positive psychology in light of Antonovsky’s theory of salutogenesis. Both positive psychology and the salutogenic paradigm challenge mainstream thought to reconsider the resources of healthy functioning. We conclude that researchers in both traditions may learn from each other. Firstly, the Sense of Coherence concept deserves greater research attention by positive psychologists in their search for understanding the mechanisms underpinning optimal functioning. Secondly, those working in the salutogenic paradigms may benefit from greater attention to the conceptualisation of healthy outcomes as defined in positive psychological terms.},

This approach generates complex, multivariate datasets that have to be presented in an intuitive way for clinicians to aid their clinical decision-making. Using network modeling and new approaches in centrality analyses, we examine “bridge nodes” between symptom stress and aspects of the psychotherapeutic process between therapy session (intersession processes, ISP). Method:, we recorded intersession processes as well as depressive and anxiety symptoms using daily questionnaires in ten cases. Regularized, thresholded intraindividual dynamic networks were estimated. We applied bridge centrality analysis to identify individual bridges between psychotherapeutic processes and symptoms in the resulting models. Case-wise interpretations of bridge centrality values are offered. Results bridge centrality analysis revealed individual bridge nodes between intersession processes and symptom severity. Strength and direction of bridges varied substantially across individuals. Conclusion given current methodological challenges, idiographic network studies are feasible and offer important insights for psychotherapy process research. In this case, we demonstrated how patients deal with periods of increased symptom stress. In this case we have described how patients deal with their therapy under increased symptom load. Bridges between psychotherapeutic processes and symptom stress are a promising target for monitoring systems based on ISP. Future studies should examine the clinical utility of network-based monitoring and feedback in ongoing therapies. In the near future, process feedback systems based on idiographic models could serve clinicians to improve treatments.},

  abstract = {Resilience is still often viewed as a unitary personality construct that, as a kind of antinosological entity, protects individuals against stress-related mental problems. However, increasing evidence indicates that maintaining mental health in the face of adversity results from complex and dynamic processes of adaptation to stressors that involve the activation of several separable protective factors. Such resilience factors can reside at biological, psychological, and social levels and may include stable predispositions (such as genotype or personality traits) and malleable properties, skills, capacities, or external circumstances (such as gene-expression patterns, emotion-regulation abilities, appraisal styles, or social support). We abandon the notion of resilience as an entity here. Starting from a conceptualization of psychiatric disorders as dynamic networks of interacting symptoms that may be driven by stressors into stable maladaptive states of disease, we deconstruct the maintenance of mental health during stressor exposure into time-variant dampening influences of resilience factors onto these symptom networks. Resilience factors are separate additional network nodes that weaken symptom–symptom interconnections or symptom autoconnections, thereby preventing maladaptive system transitions. We argue that these hybrid symptom-and-resilience-factor networks provide a promising new way of unraveling the complex dynamics of mental health.},

  abstract = {Background Identifying modifiable risk factors is essential to reduce the prevalence adolescent depression. Self-report data suggest that physical activity and sedentary behaviour might be associated with depressive symptoms in adolescents. We examined associations between depressive symptoms and objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour in adolescents. Methods From a population-based cohort of adolescents whose mothers were invited to participate in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) study, we included participants with at least one accelerometer recording and a Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) depression score at age 17·8 years (reported as age 18 years hereafter). Amounts of time spent in sedentary behaviour and physical activity (light or moderate-to-vigorous) were measured with accelerometers at around 12 years, 14 years, and 16 years of age. Total physical activity was also recorded as count per minute (CPM), with raw accelerometer counts averaged over 60 s epochs. Associations between the physical activity and sedentary behaviour variables and depression (CIS-R) scores at age 18 years were analysed with regression and group-based trajectory modelling. Findings 4257 adolescents from the 14\hphantom{,}901 enrolled in the ALSPAC study had a CIS-R depression score at age 18 years. Longitudinal analyses included 2486 participants at age 12 years, 1938 at age 14 years, and 1220 at age 16 years. Total follow-up time was 6 years. Total physical activity decreased between 12 years and 16 years of age, driven by decreasing durations of light activity (mean 325·66 min/day [SD 58·09] at 12 years; 244·94 min/day [55·08] at 16 years) and increasing sedentary behaviour (430·99 min/day [65·80]; 523·02 min/day [65·25]). Higher depression scores at 18 years were associated with a 60 min/day increase in sedentary behaviour at 12 years (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1·111 [95\% CI 1·051–1·176]), 14 years (1·080 [1·012–1·152]), and 16 years of age (1·107 [1·015–1·208]). Depression scores at 18 years were lower for every additional 60 min/day of light activity at 12 years (0·904 [0·850–0·961]), 14 years (0·922 [0·857–0·992]), and 16 years of age (0·889 [0·809–0·974]). Group-based trajectory modelling across 12–16 years of age identified three latent subgroups of sedentary behaviour and activity levels. Depression scores were higher in those with persistently high (IRR 1·282 [95\% CI 1·061–1·548]) and persistently average (1·249 [1·078–1·446]) sedentary behaviour compared with those with persistently low sedentary behaviour, and were lower in those with persistently high levels of light activity (0·804 [0·652–0·990]) compared with those with persistently low levels of light activity. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (per 15 min/day increase) at age 12 years (0·910 [0·857–0·966]) and total physical activity (per 100 CPM increase) at ages 12 years (0·941 [0·910–0·972]) and 14 years (0·965 [0·932–0·999]), were negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Interpretation Sedentary behaviour displaces light activity throughout adolescence, and is associated with a greater risk of depressive symptoms at 18 years of age. Increasing light activity and decreasing sedentary behaviour during adolescence could be an important target for public health interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of depression.

In this review, we comprehensively assess key biological and psychosocial mechanisms through which physical activity exerts antidepressant effects, with a particular focus on exercise. Exercise, a subset of physical activity, influences a range of biological and psychosocial processes also implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. We focus on the capacity for exercise to elicit changes in neuroplasticity, inflammation, oxidative stress, the endocrine system, self-esteem, social support and self-efficacy. We also discuss how a better understanding of these mechanisms can inform the way we design and implement exercise-based interventions to maximise their antidepressant effects on an individual basis. We conclude by presenting a conceptual framework of the key biological and psychosocial mechanisms underlying the relationship between physical activity and depressive symptoms, and the moderators and confounders that may influence it.},

  abstract = {In a world of big data and computational resources, there has been a growing interest in further validating computational models of decision making by subjecting them to more rigorous constraints. One prominent area of study is model-based cognitive neuroscience, where measures of neural activity are explained and interpreted through the lens of a cognitive model. Although some early work has developed the statistical framework for exploiting the covariation between brain and behavior through factor analysis linking functions, current methods are still far from providing parsimonious accounts of high-dimensional (e.g., voxel-level) data. In this article, we contribute to this endeavor by investigating the fidelity of regularization methods such as the Lasso. Here, a combination of local and global penalty terms are applied to pressure elements of the factor loading matrix toward zero, reducing the false alarm rate. Such penalties facilitate the emergence of parsimonious network structure in the study of neural activation, giving way to clearer interpretations of high-dimensional data. We show through a set of three simulation studies and one application to real data that the Lasso can be an effective regularization method in the context of linking complex patterns of brain data to theoretical explanations of decisions. Although our analyses are specific to linking brain to behavior, the structure of the model is invariant to the type of high-dimensional data under investigation.

Thirteen participants completed a standardized diary over a 10-week period, resulting in 1,860 measurement points. Valence, energetic arousal, and calmness are the three subscales of mood that were assessed. Participants rated their mood promptly after self-selected activities. A multilevel analysis indicates that the three dimensions of mood were positively affected by episodes of physical activity, such as walking or gardening-valence: t(12) = 5.6, p {$<$} .001; energetic arousal: t(12) = 2.4, p = .033; calmness: t(12) = 2.8, p = .015. Moreover, the association is affected by the individual baseline mood level, with the greatest effect seen when mood is depressed.},

  abstract = {Several meta-analyses have investigated the association between physical activity and affective states and have found evidence suggesting that exercise exerts a positive effect on affective state. However, in this field of research, most studies have conducted between-subject analyses. Nonetheless, there is more and more interest in the within-subject associations between physical activity and momentary affective states in everyday life. This position statement pertains to this up-and-coming field of research and provides methodological recommendations for further studies. The paper is divided into three parts: First, we summarise and evaluate three methodological requirements necessary for the proper evaluation of within-subject associations between physical activity and momentary affective states in everyday life. We propose that the following issues should be considered: a) to address the dynamic nature of such relationships, repeated assessments are necessary; b) as activities performed in everyday life are mostly spontaneous and unconscious, an objective assessment of physical activity is useful; c) given that recall of affective states is often affected by systematic distortions, real-time assessment is preferable. In sum, we suggest the use of ambulatory assessment techniques, and more specifically the combination of acceloremeter-assessment of physical activity with an electronic diary assessment of the momentary affective state and additional context information. Second, we summarise 22 empirical studies published between 1980 and 2012 using ambulatory assessment to investigate within-subject associations between momentary affective states and physical activity in everyday life. Generally, the literature overview detects a positive association, which appears stronger among those studies that were of high methodological quality. Third, we propose the use of ambulatory assessment intervention strategies to change people's behaviour (ambulatory assessment int},

Dynamic borrowing via Bayesian hierarchical models is a special case of a general framework of historical borrowing where the degree of borrowing depends on the heterogeneity among historical data and current data. A joint prior distribution over the historical and current data sets is specified with the degree of heterogeneity across the data sets controlled by the variance of the joint distribution. We apply Bayesian dynamic borrowing to both single-level and multilevel models and compare this approach to other historical borrowing methods such as complete pooling, Bayesian synthesis, and power priors. Two case studies using data from the Program for International Student Assessment reveal the utility of Bayesian dynamic borrowing in terms of predictive accuracy. This is followed by two simulation studies that reveal the utility of Bayesian dynamic borrowing over simple pooling and power priors in cases where the historical data is heterogeneous compared to the current data based on bias, mean squared error, and predictive accuracy. In cases of homogeneous historical data, Bayesian dynamic borrowing performs similarly to data pooling, Bayesian synthesis, and power priors. In contrast, for heterogeneous historical data, Bayesian dynamic borrowing performed at least as well, if not better, than other methods of borrowing with respect to mean squared error, percent bias, and leave-one-out cross-validation.},

In the United States, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has provided long-term trend data since 1970; at the state/jurisdiction level, NAEP has provided long-term trend data since 1996. In addition to the national NAEP, all 50 states and United States jurisdictions participate in the state NAEP assessment. Thus, NAEP provides important monitoring and forecasting information regarding population-level academic performance of relevance to national and international goals. However, an inspection of NAEP trend reports shows that relatively simple trend plots are provided; and although these plots are important for communicating general trend information, we argue that much more useful information can be obtained by adopting a Bayesian probabilistic forecasting point of view. The purpose of this paper is to provide a Bayesian probabilistic forecasting workflow that can be used with large-scale assessment trend data generally, and to demonstrate that workflow with an application to the state NAEP assessments.},

  abstract = {Issues of model selection have dominated the theoretical and applied statistical literature for decades. Model selection methods such as ridge regression, the lasso, and the elastic net have replaced ad hoc methods such as stepwise regression as a means of model selection. In the end, however, these methods lead to a single final model that is often taken to be the model considered ahead of time, thus ignoring the uncertainty inherent in the search for a final model. One method that has enjoyed a long history of theoretical developments and substantive applications, and that accounts directly for uncertainty in model selection, is Bayesian model averaging (BMA). BMA addresses the problem of model selection by not selecting a final model, but rather by averaging over a space of possible models that could have generated the data. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed and up-to-date review of BMA with a focus on its foundations in Bayesian decision theory and Bayesian predictive modeling. We consider the selection of parameter and model priors as well as methods for evaluating predictions based on BMA. We also consider important assumptions regarding BMA and extensions of model averaging methods to address these assumptions, particularly the method of Bayesian stacking. Simple empirical examples are provided and directions for future research relevant to psychometrics are discussed.},

We call this new approach Gaussian Process Panel Modeling (GPPM). GPPM provides great flexibility because of the large number of models it can represent. It allows classical statistical inference as well as machine learning inspired predictive modeling. GPPM offers frequentist and Bayesian inference without the need to resort to Markov chain Monte Carlo-based approximations, which makes the approach exact and fast. GPPMs are defined using the kernel-language, which can express many traditional modeling approaches for longitudinal data, such as linear structural equation models, multilevel models, or state-space models but also various commonly used machine learning approaches. As a result, GPPM is uniquely able to represent hybrid models combining traditional parametric longitudinal models and nonparametric machine learning models. In the present paper, we introduce GPPM and illustrate its utility through theoretical arguments as well as simulated and empirical data.},

In this study, we examined whether the depressive state would be correlated with the actigraphic-derived daytime activity levels (DAL) and total sleep time (TST) in students with no psychiatric disorders. Method Consenting volunteers were monitored at home for 3–4~days with a wrist actigraph. The DALs for 3~h before noon (DAL-M) and after 13:00~h (DAL-A) were calculated. The states of sleep and wakefulness were judged based on the activity levels, using a special algorithm. On the first day of the recording, the subjects were requested to fill a questionnaire, “Center of Epidemiologic Scale for Depression Scale (CES-D),” to evaluate the severity of their depressive state. Results There was a significant correlation between the DAL-M and DAL-A in both males (r=0.52, n=27) and females (r=0.50, n=21). TST was significantly correlated with depressive state only in the females (r=−0.49, n=28). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the DAL and the severity of the depressive state. By multiple regression analysis, TST was only a good predictor of depressive state. Conclusion The results of this investigation suggest that TST could be used as an index of the depressive state. The TST values in this study decreased as the severity of the depressive state increased, which suggests an association between the severity of the depressive state and insufficient sleep.},

  abstract = {The longitudinal process that leads to university student dropout in STEM subjects can be described by referring to (a) inter-individual differences (e.g., cognitive abilities) as well as (b) intra-individual changes (e.g., affective states), (c) (unobserved) heterogeneity of trajectories, and d) time-dependent variables. Large dynamic latent variable model frameworks for intensive longitudinal data (ILD) have been proposed which are (partially) capable of simultaneously separating the complex data structures (e.g., DLCA; Asparouhov et al. in Struct Equ Model 24:257–269, 2017; DSEM; Asparouhov et al. in Struct Equ Model 25:359–388, 2018; NDLC-SEM, Kelava and Brandt in Struct Equ Model 26:509–528, 2019). From a methodological perspective, forecasting in dynamic frameworks allowing for real-time inferences on latent or observed variables based on ongoing data collection has not been an extensive research topic. From a practical perspective, there has been no empirical study on student dropout in math that integrates ILD, dynamic frameworks, and forecasting of critical states of the individuals allowing for real-time interventions. In this paper, we show how Bayesian forecasting of multivariate intra-individual variables and time-dependent class membership of individuals (affective states) can be performed in these dynamic frameworks using a Forward Filtering Backward Sampling method. To illustrate our approach, we use an empirical example where we apply the proposed forecasting method to ILD from a large university student dropout study in math with multivariate observations collected over 50 measurement occasions from multiple students (\$\$N = 122\$\$). More specifically, we forecast emotions and behavior related to dropout. This allows us to predict emerging critical dynamic states (e.g., critical stress levels or pre-decisional states) 8 weeks before the actual dropout occurs.},

  abstract = {The relationship between sleep and adolescent depression is much discussed, but still not fully understood. One important sleep variable is self-selected sleep timing, which is also referred to as chronotype. Chronotype is mostly regulated by the circadian clock that synchronises the internal time of the body with the external light dark cycle. A late chronotype as well as a misalignment between internal time and external time such as social jetlag has been shown to be associated with depressive symptoms in adults. In this study, we investigated whether adolescents with remitted depression differ from healthy controls in terms of chronotype, social jetlag and other sleep-related variables. For this purpose, we assessed chronotype and social jetlag with the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ), subjective sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and used continuous wrist-actimetry over 31 consecutive days to determine objective sleep timing. Given the potentially mediating effect of light on chronotype and depressive symptoms, we measured light exposure with a light sensor on the actimeter. In our sample, adolescents with remitted depression showed similar chronotypes and similar amounts of social jetlag compared to controls. However, patients with remitted depression slept significantly longer on work-free days and reported a worse subjective sleep quality than controls. Additionally, light exposure in remitted patients was significantly higher, but this finding was mediated by living in a rural environment. These findings indicate that chronotype might be modified during remission, which should be further investigated in longitudinal studies.},

Here, we test the idea that the connectivity of emotion networks is associated with more extreme fluctuations in depression over time, rather than necessarily more severe depression. We gathered data from two independent samples of N = 155 paid students and N = 194 citizen scientists who rated their positive and negative emotions on a smartphone app twice a day and completed a weekly depression questionnaire for 8 wk. We constructed thousands of personalized emotion networks for each participant and tested whether connectivity was associated with severity of depression or its variance over 8 wk. Network connectivity was positively associated with baseline depression severity in citizen scientists, but not paid students. In contrast, 8-wk variance of depression was correlated with network connectivity in both samples. When controlling for depression variance, the association between connectivity and baseline depression severity in citizen scientists was no longer significant. We replicated these findings in an independent community sample (N = 519). We conclude that elevated network connectivity is associated with greater variability in depression symptoms. This variability only translates into increased severity in samples where depression is on average low and positively skewed, causing mean and variance to be more strongly correlated. These findings, although correlational, suggest that while emotional network connectivity could predispose individuals to severe depression, it could also be leveraged to bring about therapeutic improvements.},

While prediction schemes based on symptom clustering and biomarkers have so far not yielded results of sufficient strength to inform clinical decision-making, prediction schemes based on big data predictive analytic models might be more practically useful.                                          Method.                We review evidence suggesting that prediction equations based on symptoms and other easily-assessed clinical features found in previous research to predict MDD treatment outcomes might provide a foundation for developing predictive analytic clinical decision support models that could help clinicians select optimal (personalised) MDD treatments. These methods could also be useful in targeting patient subsamples for more expensive biomarker assessments.                                          Results.                Approximately two dozen baseline variables obtained from medical records or patient reports have been found repeatedly in MDD treatment trials to predict overall treatment outcomes (i.e., intervention v. control) or differential treatment outcomes (i.e., intervention A v. intervention B). Similar evidence has been found in observational studies of MDD persistence-severity. However, no treatment studies have yet attempted to develop treatment outcome equations using the full set of these predictors. Promising preliminary empirical results coupled with recent developments in statistical methodology suggest that models could be developed to provide useful clinical decision support in personalised treatment selection. These tools could also provide a strong foundation to increase statistical power in focused studies of biomarkers and MDD heterogeneity of treatment response in subsequent controlled trials.                                          Conclusions.                Coordinated efforts are needed to develop a protocol for systematically collecting information about established predictors of heterogeneity of MDD treatment response in large observational treatment studies, applying and refining these models in subsequent pragmatic trials, carrying out pooled secondary analyses to extract the maximum amount of information from these coordinated studies, and using this information to focus future discovery efforts in the segment of the patient population in which continued uncertainty about treatment response exists.},

  abstract = {Clustered data can frequently be found not only in social and behavioral sciences (e.g., multiple measurements of individuals) but also in typical machine learning problems (e.g., weather forecast in different cities, house prices in different regions). This implies dependencies for observations within one cluster, leading to violations of independent and identically distributed assumptions, biased estimates, and false inference. A typical approach to address this issue is to include random effects instead of fixed effects. We introduce the general mixed effects machine learning framework (mixedML), which includes random effects in supervised regression machine learning models, and present different estimation procedures. A segmentation of the problem allows to include random effects as an additional correction to the standard machine learning regression problem. Thus, the framework can be applied on top of the machine learning task, without the need to change the model or architecture, which distinguishes mixedML from other models in this field. With a simulation study and empirical data sets, we show that the framework produces comparable estimates to typical mixed effects frameworks in the linear case and increases the prediction quality and the gained information of the standard machine learning models in both the linear and non-linear case. Furthermore, the presented estimation procedures significantly decrease estimation time. Compared to other approaches in this area, the framework does not restrict the choice of machine learning algorithms and still includes random effects.},

  abstract = {Background: Although geriatric depression is prevalent, diagnosis using self-reporting instruments has limitations when measuring the depressed mood of older adults in a community setting. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) by using wearable devices could be used to collect data to classify older adults into depression groups. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the classification of depression groups among older adults living alone. We focused on utilizing diverse data collected through a survey, an Actiwatch, and an EMA report related to depression. Methods: The prediction model using machine learning was developed in 4 steps: (1) data collection, (2) data processing and representation, (3) data modeling (feature engineering and selection), and (4) training and validation to test the prediction model. Older adults (N=47), living alone in community settings, completed an EMA to report depressed moods 4 times a day for 2 weeks between May 2017 and January 2018. Participants wore an Actiwatch that measured their activity and ambient light exposure every 30 seconds for 2 weeks. At baseline and the end of the 2-week observation, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Korean versions of the Short Geriatric Depression Scale (SGDS-K) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (K-HDRS). Conventional classification based on binary logistic regression was built and compared with 4 machine learning models (the logit, decision tree, boosted tree, and random forest models). Results: On the basis of the SGDS-K and K-HDRS, 38\% (18/47) of the participants were classified into the probable depression group. They reported significantly lower scores of normal mood and physical activity and higher levels of white and red, green, and blue (RGB) light exposures at different degrees of various 4-hour time frames (all P{$<$}.05). Sleep efficiency was chosen for modeling through feature selection. Comparing diverse combinations of the selected variables, daily mean EMA score, daily mean activity level, white and RGB light at 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm exposure, and daily sleep efficiency were selected for modeling. Conventional classification based on binary logistic regression had a good model fit (accuracy: 0.705; precision: 0.770; specificity: 0.859; and area under receiver operating characteristic curve or AUC: 0.754). Among the 4 machine learning models, the logit model had the best fit compared with the others (accuracy: 0.910; precision: 0.929; specificity: 0.940; and AUC: 0.960). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for developing a machine learning program to predict the classification of depression groups in older adults living alone. Clinicians should consider using this method to identify underdiagnosed subgroups and monitor daily progression regarding treatment or therapeutic intervention in the community setting. Furthermore, more efforts are needed for researchers and clinicians to diversify data collection methods by using a survey, EMA, and a sensor.},

We collected data from 265 consecutively recruited patients and 260 non-clinical control persons using self-report measures of attachment, depression, and socio-demographic characteristics. The effects of treatment on patients were analyzed using propensity score techniques (propensity strata and logit-transformed propensity scores) in combination with a generalized analysis of covariance. A moderate increase of attachment security was found which could be attributed to a decrease both in attachment anxiety and avoidance. Pre-post improvements in attachment with regard to romantic partnerships were stable after a 1-year follow-up. Furthermore, we found significant treatment-covariate interactions indicating that subjects with particularly high treatment propensities (propensities were highly correlated with depression and attachment anxiety) improved the most in terms of attachment security. Our results are encouraging for psychotherapeutic practice in that they provide evidence that long-term attachment improvements can be reached via psychotherapy. Our results will also provide a sound basis for future studies in the field of clinical attachment research, e.g., studies examining whether improved attachment security is correlated to symptom improvements in different psychological disorders.},

  abstract = {Forecasting the weather is an increasingly data intensive exercise. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are becoming more complex, with higher resolutions, and there are increasing numbers of different models in operation. While the forecasting skill of NWP models continues to improve, the number and complexity of these models poses a new challenge for the operational meteorologist: how should the information from all available models, each with their own unique biases and limitations, be combined in order to provide stakeholders with well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts to use in decision making? In this paper, we use a road surface temperature example to demonstrate a three-stage framework that uses machine learning to bridge the gap between sets of separate forecasts from NWP models and the 'ideal' forecast for decision support: probabilities of future weather outcomes. First, we use Quantile Regression Forests to learn the error profile of each numerical model, and use these to apply empirically-derived probability distributions to forecasts. Second, we combine these probabilistic forecasts using quantile averaging. Third, we interpolate between the aggregate quantiles in order to generate a full predictive distribution, which we demonstrate has properties suitable for decision support. Our results suggest that this approach provides an effective and operationally viable framework for the cohesive post-processing of weather forecasts across multiple models and lead times to produce a well-calibrated probabilistic output.},

  abstract = {A growing interest in understanding complex and dynamic psychological processes as they occur in everyday life has led to an increase in studies using ambulatory assessment techniques, including the experience-sampling method (ESM) and ecological momentary assessment. These methods, however, tend to involve numerous forking paths and researcher degrees of freedom, even beyond those typically encountered with other research methodologies. Although a number of researchers working with ESM techniques are actively engaged in efforts to increase the methodological rigor and transparency of research that uses them, currently there is little routine implementation of open-science practices in ESM research. In this article, we discuss the ways in which ESM research is especially vulnerable to threats to transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. We propose that greater use of study registration, a cornerstone of open science, may address some of these threats to the transparency of ESM research. Registration of ESM research is not without challenges, including model selection, accounting for potential model-convergence issues, and the use of preexisting data sets. As these may prove to be significant barriers for ESM researchers, we also discuss ways of overcoming these challenges and of documenting them in a registration. A further challenge is that current general preregistration templates do not adequately capture the unique features of ESM. We present a registration template for ESM research and also discuss registration of studies using preexisting data.},

Multilevel polynomial regression followed by response surface analysis was used to examine how the attachment anxiety and avoidance of the individual group member and the aggregated attachment anxiety and avoidance of the group members were related to individual group members’ perceptions of the positive bonding, positive working relationships, and negative relationships in the group. The findings suggested that attachment heterogeneity in group is related to the perception of members’ stronger bonding relationships and lower negative relationships. In addition, positive bonding can be increased when a patient high in attachment avoidance is added to a group whose patients are low in attachment avoidance; however, group members reported weaker negative relationships when their attachment anxiety or avoidance became increasingly higher or lower than other group members’ attachment anxiety or avoidance.},

We extend the recently proposed vibration of effects approach to provide a framework comparing three main sources of uncertainty which lead to instability in empirical findings, namely data pre-processing, model, and sampling uncertainty. We analyze the behavior of these sources for varying sample sizes for two associations in personality psychology. Through the joint investigation of model and data pre-processing vibration, we can compare the relative impact of these two types of uncertainty and identify the most influential analytical choices. While all types of vibration show a decrease for increasing sample sizes, data pre-processing and model vibration remain non-negligible, even for a sample of over 80000 participants. The increasing availability of large data sets that are not initially recorded for research purposes can make data pre-processing and model choices very influential. We therefore recommend the framework as a tool for transparent reporting of the stability of research findings.},

The topic has sparked increasing interest in counseling and psychotherapy research, where it has been found to be associated with the therapeutic alliance, clinicians’ empathy and patients’ outcome. Physiological synchronization allows researcher to investigate subtle but fundamental aspects of the clinical process through objective measures. In this article, we aim to offer a guide to researchers and clinicians to explore this growing field of study. We begin by reviewing the existing literature of physiological synchronization in clinical relationships, and then we provide practical guidelines for research. We discuss the various aspects involved in synchronization studies: study design, selection of physiological signals, data analytic approaches, and interpretation of results. To better illustrate how to implement these types of design, we provide a running example describing the data collection and analysis of a single-case study. In the example we discuss both how to conduct a longitudinal nomothetic analysis, as well as a moment-to-moment idiographic exploration of the clinical content. In this latter analysis, in particular, we show how physiological synchronization can be used in combination with 2 transcripts analysis tools, the Patient Attachment Coding System, and the Therapist Attunement Scales to reach a deeper understanding of the ongoing processes. We conclude by arguing that research in counseling and psychotherapy has much to gain from and contribute to the overall development of our understanding of physiological synchronization in human interaction.

  abstract = {Personalized case conceptualization is often regarded as a prerequisite for treatment success in psychotherapy for patients with comorbidity. This article presents Perceived Causal Networks, a novel method in which patients rate perceived causal relations among behavioral and emotional problems. First, 231 respondents screening positive for depression completed an online Perceived Causal Networks questionnaire. Median completion time (including repeat items to assess immediate test–retest reliability) was 22.7 minutes, and centrality measures showed excellent immediate test–retest reliability. Networks were highly idiosyncratic, but worrying and ruminating were the most central items for a third of respondents. Second, 50 psychotherapists rated the clinical utility of Perceived Causal Networks visualizations. Ninety-six percent rated the networks as clinically useful, and the information in the individual visualizations was judged to contain 47\% of the information typically collected during a psychotherapy assessment phase. Future studies should individualize networks further and evaluate the validity of perceived causal relations.},

  abstract = {Experience sampling studies into daily-life affective reactivity indicate that depressed individuals react more strongly to both positive and negative stimuli than non-depressed individuals, particularly on negative affect (NA). Given the different mean levels of both positive affect (PA) and NA between patients and controls, such findings may be influenced by floor/ceiling effects, leading to violations of the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions underlying the used statistical models. Affect distributions in prior studies suggest that this may have particularly influenced NA-reactivity findings. Here, we investigated the influence of floor/ceiling effects on the observed PA- and NA-reactivity to both positive and negative events. Data came from 346 depressed, non-depressed, and remitted participants from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). In PA-reactivity analyses, no floor/ceiling effects and assumption violations were observed, and PA-reactivity to positive events, but not negative events, was significantly increased in the depressed and remitted groups versus the non-depressed group. However, NA-scores exhibited a floor effect in the non-depressed group and naively estimated models violated model assumptions. When these violations were accounted for in subsequent analyses, group differences in NA-reactivity that had been present in the naive models were no longer observed. In conclusion, we found increased PA-reactivity to positive events but no evidence of increased NA-reactivity in depressed individuals when accounting for violations of assumptions. The results indicate that affective-reactivity results are very sensitive to modeling choices and that previously observed increased NA-reactivity in depressed individuals may (partially) reflect unaddressed assumption violations resulting from floor effects in NA.},

  abstract = {Standard response formats such as rating or visual analogue scales require respondents to condense distributions of latent states or behaviors into a single value. Whereas this is suitable to measure central tendency, it neglects the variance of distributions. As a remedy, variability may be measured using interval-response formats, more specifically the dual-range slider (RS2). Given the lack of an appropriate item response model for the RS2, we develop the Dirichlet dual response model (DDRM), an extension of the beta response model (BRM; Noel \& Dauvier, 2007). We evaluate the DDRM’s performance by assessing parameter recovery in a simulation study. Results indicate overall good parameter recovery, although parameters concerning interval width (which reflect variability in behavior or states) perform worse than parameters concerning central tendency. We also test the model empirically by jointly fitting the BRM and the DDRM to single-range slider (RS1) and RS2 responses for two extraversion scales. While the DDRM has an acceptable fit, it shows some misfit regarding the RS2 interval widths. Nonetheless, the model indicates substantial differences between respondents concerning variability in behavior. High correlations between person parameters of the BRM and DDRM suggest convergent validity between the RS1 and the RS2 interval location. Both the simulation and the empirical study demonstrate that the latent parameter space of the DDRM addresses an important issue of the RS2 response format, namely, the scale-inherent interdependence of interval location and interval width (i.e., intervals at the boundaries are necessarily smaller).},

  abstract = {Physical activity is known to preserve both physical and mental health. However, the physical activity levels of a large proportion of adolescents are below the accepted recommendations. This is critical, since physical activity levels in youth have been shown to translate into adulthood, making the promotion of physical activity in adolescence a major health issue. In adult populations, mood has been suggested to be one important psychological factor that drives physical activity in everyday life, i.e., non-exercise activity. However, the association of mood and physical activity in adolescents’ everyday lives has been poorly studied. Ambulatory Assessment is the state-of-the-art approach to investigating how the association between mood and non-exercise activity waxes and wanes within persons in everyday life. Through assessments in real time and real life, this method provides ecological validity, bypassing several limitations of traditional assessment methods (e.g., recall biases). To investigate whether mood is associated with non-exercise activity in adolescents, we equipped a community-based sample comprising 113 participants, aged 12-17 years, with GPS-triggered e-diaries and accelerometers for use in their everyday lives for one week. We used multilevel analyses to compute the effects of several mood dimensions (i.e., valence, energetic arousal, and calmness) on non-exercise activity within 10-minute intervals following each e-diary prompt. Additionally, we conducted explorative analyses of the time course of the effects, i.e., on different timeframes of non-exercise activity up to 300 minutes following the mood assessment. The results showed that valence (p {$<$} 0.001) and energetic arousal (p {$<$} 0.001) were positively associated with non-exercise activity within the 10 minutes interval, whereas calmness (p {$<$} 0.001) was negatively associated with non-exercise activity. Specifically, adolescents who felt more content, full of energy, or less calm were more physically active in subsequent timeframes. Overall, our results demonstrate close associations of non-exercise activity with mood in younger ages and converge with the previously observed association between mood and physical activity in adults. In the future, we propose to investigate how these findings could be translated for use in interventions in adolescents’ everyday lives, e.g., using ambulatory assessment interventions.},

Whereas recent computing and methodological advances have permitted increased efficiency in the simulation process, known as variance reduction, such experiments remain limited by their finite nature and hence are subject to uncertainty; when a simulation is run more than once, different results are obtained. However, virtually no emphasis has been placed on reporting the uncertainty, referred to here as Monte Carlo error, associated with simulation results in the published literature, or on justifying the number of replications used. These deserve broader consideration. Here we present a series of simple and practical methods for estimating Monte Carlo error as well as determining the number of replications required to achieve a desired level of accuracy. The issues and methods are demonstrated with two simple examples, one evaluating operating characteristics of the maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters in logistic regression and the other in the context of using the bootstrap to obtain 95\% confidence intervals. The results suggest that in many settings, Monte Carlo error may be more substantial than traditionally thought.},

  abstract = {Background. This study examined the associations between accelerometer-derived sedentary time (ST), lower intensity physical activity (LPA), higher intensity physical activity (HPA) and the incidence of depressive symptoms over 4 years of follow-up. Methods. We included 2082 participants from The Maastricht Study (mean ± S.D. age 60.1 ± 8.0 years; 51.2\% men) without depressive symptoms at baseline. ST, LPA and HPA were measured with the ActivPAL3 activity monitor. Depressive symptoms were measured annually over 4 years of follow-up with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the associations between ST, LPA, HPA and incident depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ⩾ 10). Analyses were adjusted for total waking time per day, age, sex, education level, type 2 diabetes mellitus, body mass index, total energy intake, smoking status and alcohol use. Results. During 7812.81 person-years of follow-up, 203 (9.8\%) participants developed incident depressive symptoms. No significant associations [Hazard Ratio (95\% confidence interval)] were found between sex-specific tertiles of ST (lowest v. highest tertile) [1.13 (0.76–1.66], or HPA (highest v. lowest tertile) [1.14 (0.78–1.69)] and incident depressive symptoms. LPA (highest v. lowest tertile) was statistically significantly associated with incident depressive symptoms in women [1.98 (1.19–3.29)], but not in men (p-interaction {$<$}0.01). Conclusions. We did not observe an association between ST or HPA and incident depressive symptoms. Lower levels of daily LPA were associated with an increased risk of incident depressive symptoms in women. Future research is needed to investigate accelerometerderived measured physical activity and ST with incident depressive symptoms, preferably stratified by sex.},

However, the relevance of IADs for the prediction of time?invariant outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms) was recently challenged due to results suggesting low predictive utility beyond intraindividual means and variances. We argue that these results may in part be explained by mathematical redundancies between IADs and static variability. In two extensive simulation studies we investigate the accuracy and power for detecting non-null relations between IADs and an outcome variable in different relevant settings, illustrating the effect of the length of a time series as well as of the presence of missing values or measurement error. We show that, if uncertainty in individual IAD estimates is not accounted for, relations between IADs (i.e., autoregressive effects) and a time-invariant outcome are underestimated even in large samples and propose the use of a latent multilevel one-step approach. In an empirical application we illustrate that the different modeling approaches can lead to different substantive conclusions regarding the  role of negative affect inertia in the prediction of depressive symptoms.},

One hundred fifty-four students reported their time use and valence hourly over 7 days, both at the start of the semester and during their examination period. Motivational problems, social support and self-control were assessed once via questionnaires. Whereas the mean academic time use was in the expected range, the between-subject differences were substantial. We used multilevel modeling to separately analyze the within- and between-subject associations of valence as within factor and time use and social support, self-control, and motivation as between factors and time use. The analyses revealed the importance of affective factors on a within-subject level. Before studying, valence was already low, and it deteriorated further during studying. As expected at the between-subject level, motivational problems were related to less time studying, whereas surprisingly, self-control had no effect. The findings at the start of the semester were replicated in the examination period.},

However, the reduced precision of trait estimates in this questionnaire format is an important drawback. Accordingly, this article presents an optimization procedure for assembling pairwise forced-choice questionnaires while maximizing posterior marginal reliabilities. This procedure is performed through the adaptation of a known genetic algorithm (GA) for combinatorial problems. In a simulation study, the efficiency of the proposed procedure was compared with a quasi-brute-force (BF) search. For this purpose, five-dimensional item pools were simulated to emulate the real problem of generating a forced-choice personality questionnaire under the five-factor model. Three factors were manipulated: (1) the length of the questionnaire, (2) the relative item pool size with respect to the questionnaire’s length, and (3) the true correlations between traits. The recovery of the person parameters for each assembled questionnaire was evaluated through the squared correlation between estimated and true parameters, the root mean square error between the estimated and true parameters, the average difference between the estimated and true inter-trait correlations, and the average standard error for each trait level. The proposed GA offered more accurate trait estimates than the BF search within a reasonable computation time in every simulation condition. Such improvements were especially important when measuring correlated traits and when the relative item pool sizes were higher. A user-friendly online implementation of the algorithm was made available to the users.},

  abstract = {Background: Health promotion can be tailored by combining ecological momentary assessments (EMA) with time series analysis. This combined method allows for studying the temporal order of dynamic relationships among variables, which may provide concrete indications for intervention. However, application of this method in health care practice is hampered because analyses are conducted manually and advanced statistical expertise is required. Objective: This study aims to show how this limitation can be overcome by introducing automated vector autoregressive modeling (VAR) of EMA data and to evaluate its feasibility through comparisons with results of previously published manual analyses. Methods: We developed a Web-based open source application, called AutoVAR, which automates time series analyses of EMA data and provides output that is intended to be interpretable by nonexperts. The statistical technique we used was VAR. AutoVAR tests and evaluates all possible VAR models within a given combinatorial search space and summarizes their results, thereby replacing the researcher\&\#8217;s tasks of conducting the analysis, making an informed selection of models, and choosing the best model. We compared the output of AutoVAR to the output of a previously published manual analysis (n=4). Results: An illustrative example consisting of 4 analyses was provided. Compared to the manual output, the AutoVAR output presents similar model characteristics and statistical results in terms of the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the test statistic of the Granger causality test. Conclusions: Results suggest that automated analysis and interpretation of times series is feasible. Compared to a manual procedure, the automated procedure is more robust and can save days of time. These findings may pave the way for using time series analysis for health promotion on a larger scale. AutoVAR was evaluated using the results of a previously conducted manual analysis. Analysis of additional datasets is needed in order to validate and refine the application for general use.},

  abstract = {Polynomial regression is an old and commonly discussed modeling technique, though recommendations for its usage are widely variable. Here, we make the case that polynomial regression with second- and third-order terms should be part of every applied practitioners standard model-building toolbox, and should be taught to new students of the subject as the default technique to model nonlinearity. We argue that polynomial regression is superior to nonparametric alternatives for nonstatisticians due to its ease of interpretation, flexibility, and its nonreliance on sophisticated mathematics, like knots and kernel smoothing. This makes it the ideal default for nonstatisticians interested in building realistic models that can capture global as well as local effects of predictors on a response variable. Low-order polynomial regression can effectively model compact floor and ceiling effects, local linearity, and prevent inferring the presence of spurious interaction effects between distinct predictors when none are present. We also argue that the case against polynomial regression is largely specious, relying on either misconceptions around the method, strawman arguments, or historical artifacts.

  abstract = {Background. A number of self-administered questionnaires are available for assessing depression severity, including the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9). Because even briefer measures might be desirable for use in busy clinical settings or as part of comprehensive health questionnaires, we evaluated a 2-item version of the PHQ depression module, the PHQ-2. Methods. The PHQ-2 inquires about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks, scoring each as 0 ("not at all") to 3 ("nearly every day"). The PHQ-2 was completed by 6000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. Results. As PHQ-2 depression severity increased from 0 to 6, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and healthcare utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-2 score ≥3 had a sensitivity of 83\% and a specificity of 92\% for major depression. Likelihood ratio and receiver operator characteristic analysis identified a PHQ-2 score of 3 as the optimal cutpoint for screening purposes. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. Conclusion. The construct and criterion validity of the PHQ-2 make it an attractive measure for depression screening.}

  abstract = {Background and Objectives. In the proposed symptom network approach to psychopathology, psychiatric disorders are assumed to result from the (causal) interplay between symptoms. By implementing this approach we explored whether individual feedback on symptom dynamics complements current categorical classification and treatment. The aim of this proof-of-principle case-study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability and usability of this transdiagnostic approach. Methods. A female patient, aged 67, suffering from treatment resistant anxious and depressive symptoms was treated in our tertiary outpatient clinic for old age psychiatry. She participated in ecological momentary assessments (EMA), which involved intensive repeated measurements of mood and context-related items during two weeks. Visualizations of the interplay between the items were provided by network graphs and were discussed with the patient. Results. Network graphs were discussed with the patient. For example, it was hypothesized and discussed with the patient that feeling relaxed increased physical activity, causing physical discomfort in the following hours. Physical discomfort caused stress as its symptoms resembled her feared somatic anxiety symptoms. This increased the patient’s insight that stress, expressed as somatic symptoms, played a central role in her panic disorder. This started a dialogue on how to cope with stress caused by somatic (anxiety) symptoms and provided a rationale for the patient to start an interoceptive exposure intervention she had repeatedly refused before. Limitations. The observed symptom dynamics may not be generalizable to any other random two weeks. Conclusions. Personalized diagnosis of psychopathology incorporating complex symptom dynamics is feasible and a promising addition to current categorical diagnostic systems and could guide intervention selection. This merits further exploration.},

In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of how to make and evaluate probabilistic forecasts from such simulation output. Based on proper scoring rules, we develop a notion of consistency that allows to assess the adequacy of methods for estimating the stationary distribution underlying the simulation output. We then provide asymptotic results that account for the salient features of Bayesian posterior simulators and derive conditions under which choices from the literature satisfy our notion of consistency. Importantly, these conditions depend on the scoring rule being used, such that the choices of approximation method and scoring rule are intertwined. While the logarithmic rule requires fairly stringent conditions, the continuous ranked probability score yields consistent approximations under minimal assumptions. These results are illustrated in a simulation study and an economic data example. Overall, mixture-of-parameters approximations that exploit the parametric structure of Bayesian models perform particularly well. Under the continuous ranked probability score, the empirical distribution function is a simple and appealing alternative option.},

Towards this purpose, a total of 815 articles from three major journals within the field of psychological methods and statistics were manually screened and encoded based on code sharing practices and general article characteristics. In addition, data on conventional (citation counts) and alternative research metrics (Altmetric Attention Score) was retrieved through online scientific databases (Web of Science and Altmetric.com). This input was then analysed using descriptive statistics and regression models suitable for count data, and robustness of the findings were assessed using multiverse analysis.      The findings of this study suggest that the sharing of scientific computer code is not (yet) extensively practiced within the field of psychological methods and statistics. In the majority of academic articles included in this study, scientific computer code was not shared (66 \%). Moreover, if such code was shared, it was frequently found to be improperly annotated (70 \%) and/or incomplete (52 \%). Nevertheless, the findings of this study also suggest a hopeful prospect, as the sharing of scientific computer code has increased between 2010 and 2017. The study revealed a robust positive connection with alternative research metrics. This study did not find robust positive connection between code sharing and citation counts.},

We applied group iterative multiple model estimation, using both diagnosis-based and data-driven methods to investigate similarities in unfolding within-person emotion-network time-courses. Results did not support diagnosis-based subgroupings but rather revealed two significant data-driven subgroups based on dynamic emotion patterns. These data-driven subgroups did not significantly differ in terms of clinical features or demographics, but did differ on key emotion metrics—instability, granularity, and inertia. These data-driven subgroupings, agnostic to diagnostic status, provide insights into the nature of idiographic emotion-network dynamics that cut-across clinical diagnostic divisions.},

The main outcome was reduction in depressive symptoms or remission. Results A total of 23 RCTs and 977 participants were included. Physical exercise had a moderate to large significant effect on depression compared to control conditions (g=−0.68), but the effect was small and not significant at follow-up (g=−0.22). Exercise compared to no intervention yielded a large and significant effect size (g=−1.24), and exercise had a moderate and significant effect compared to usual care (g=−0.48). The effects of exercise when compared to psychological treatments or antidepressant medication were small and not significant (g=−0.22 and g=−0.08, respectively). Exercise as an adjunct to antidepressant medication yielded a moderate effect (g=−0.50) that trended toward significance.

  abstract = {In recent years the popularity of procedures to collect intensive longitudinal data, such as the Experience Sampling Method, has immensely increased. The data collected using such designs allow researchers to study the dynamics of psychological functioning, and how these dynamics differ across individuals. To this end, the data are often modeled with multilevel regression models. An important question that arises when designing intensive longitudinal studies is how to determine the number of participants needed to test specific hypotheses regarding the parameters of these models with sufficient power. Power calculations for intensive longitudinal studies are challenging, because of the hierarchical data structure in which repeated observations are nested within the individuals and because of the serial dependence that is typically present in this data. We, therefore, present a user-friendly application and step-by-step tutorial to perform simulation-based power analyses for a set of models that are popular in intensive longitudinal research. Since many studies use the same sampling protocol (i.e., a fixed number of at least approximately equidistant observations) within individuals, we assume this protocol fixed and focus on the number of participants. All included models explicitly account for the temporal dependencies in the data by assuming serially correlated errors or including autoregressive effects.},

  abstract = {The use of multilevel VAR(1) models to unravel within-individual process dynamics is gaining momentum in psychological research. These models accommodate the structure of intensive longitudinal datasets in which repeated measurements are nested within individuals. They estimate within-individual auto- and cross-regressive relationships while incorporating and using information about the distributions of these effects across individuals. An important quality feature of the obtained estimates pertains to how well they generalize to unseen data. Bulteel and colleagues (Psychol Methods 23(4):740–756, 2018a) showed that this feature can be assessed through a cross-validation approach, yielding a predictive accuracy measure. In this article, we follow up on their results, by performing three simulation studies that allow to systematically study five factors that likely affect the predictive accuracy of multilevel VAR(1) models: (i) the number of measurement occasions per person, (ii) the number of persons, (iii) the number of variables, (iv) the contemporaneous collinearity between the variables, and (v) the distributional shape of the individual differences in the VAR(1) parameters (i.e., normal versus multimodal distributions). Simulation results show that pooling information across individuals and using multilevel techniques prevent overfitting. Also, we show that when variables are expected to show strong contemporaneous correlations, performing multilevel VAR(1) in a reduced variable space can be useful. Furthermore, results reveal that multilevel VAR(1) models with random effects have a better predictive performance than person-specific VAR(1) models when the sample includes groups of individuals that share similar dynamics.},

  abstract = {When estimating path coefficients among psychological constructs measured with error, structural equation modeling (SEM), which simultaneously estimates the measurement and structural parameters, is generally regarded as the gold standard. In practice, however, researchers usually first compute composite scores or factor scores, and use those as observed variables in a path analysis, for purposes of simplifying the model or avoiding model convergence issues. Whereas recent approaches, such as reliability adjustment methods and factor score regression, has been proposed to mitigate the bias induced by ignoring measurement error in composite/factor scores with continuous indicators, those approaches are not yet applicable to models with categorical indicators. In this article, we introduce the two-stage path analysis (2S-PA) with definition variables as a general framework for path modeling to handle categorical indicators, in which estimation of factor scores and path coefficients are separated. It thus allows for different estimation methods in the measurement and the structural path models and easier diagnoses of violations of model assumptions. We conducted three simulation studies, ranging from latent regression to mediation analysis with categorical indicators, and showed that 2S-PA generally produced similar estimates to those using SEM in large samples, but gave better convergence rates, less standard error bias, and better control of Type I error rates in small samples. We illustrate 2S-PA using data from a national data set, and show how researchers can implement it in Mplus and OpenMx. Possible extensions and future directions of 2S-PA are discussed.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Literature has shown that obesity, metabolic syndrome and inflammation are associated with depression, however, evidence suggests that these associations are specific to atypical depression. Which of the atypical symptoms are driving associations with obesity-related outcomes and inflammation is unknown. We evaluated associations between individual symptoms of depression (both atypical and non-atypical) and body mass index (BMI), metabolic syndrome components and inflammatory markers. METHODS: We included 808 persons with a current diagnosis of depression participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (67\% female, mean age 41.6 years). Depressive symptoms were derived from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses adjusting for sex, age, educational level, depression severity, current smoking, physical activity, anti-inflammatory medication use, and statin use were performed. RESULTS: Increased appetite was positively associated with BMI, number of metabolic syndrome components, waist circumference, C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-α. Decreased appetite was negatively associated with BMI and waist circumference. Psychomotor retardation was positively associated with BMI, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, and insomnia with number of metabolic syndrome components. CONCLUSION: Increased appetite - in the context of a depressive episode - was the only symptom that was associated with both metabolic as well as inflammatory markers, and could be a key feature of an immuno-metabolic form of depression. This immuno-metabolic depression should be considered in clinical trials evaluating effectiveness of compounds targeting metabolic and inflammatory pathways or lifestyle interventions.},

Much of this is attributable to the ascendance and eventual hegemony of aggregate statistical thinking within scientific psychology generally and personality psychology in particular. Based on an examination of the relevant portions of Windelband's original 1894 text, the present article seeks to clarify the misunderstandings which have resulted from this development. One objective of this contribution is to provide a more accurate historical perspective on the long-running nomothetic vs idiographic controversy. A second objective is to provide a much needed critical perspective on certain knowledge claims currently issuing from some quarters of mainstream trait psychology.},

  abstract = {Intensive longitudinal data provide psychological researchers with the potential to better understand individual-level temporal processes. While the collection of such data has become increasingly common, there are a comparatively small number of methods well-suited for analyzing these data, and many methods assume homogeneity across individuals. A recent development rooted in structural equation and vector autoregressive modeling, Subgrouping Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (S-GIMME), provides one method for arriving at individual-level models composed of processes shared by the sample, processes shared by a subset of the sample, and processes unique to a given individual. As this algorithm was motivated and validated for use with neuroimaging data, its performance and utility is less understood in the context of ambulatory assessment data collected by psychologists. Here, we evaluate the performance of the S-GIMME algorithm across various conditions frequently encountered with daily diary (compared to neuroimaging) data; namely, a smaller number of variables, a lower number of time points, and smaller autoregressive effects. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time the importance of the autoregressive effects in recovering data-generating connections and directions, and the ability to use S-GIMME with lengths of data commonly seen in daily diary studies. We demonstrate the use of the S-GIMME algorithm with an empirical example evaluating the general, shared, and unique temporal processes associated with a sample of individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Finally, we underscore the need for methods such as S-GIMME moving forward given the increasing use of intensive longitudinal data in psychological research, and the potential for these data to provide novel insights into human behavior and mental health.},

  abstract = {Background: Social interactions are important for well-being, and therefore, researchers are increasingly attempting to capture people’s social environment. Many different disciplines have developed tools to measure the social environment, which can be highly variable over time. The experience sampling method (ESM) is often used in psychology to study the dynamics within a person and the social environment. In addition, passive sensing is often used to capture social behavior via sensors from smartphones or other wearable devices. Furthermore, sociologists use egocentric networks to track how social relationships are changing. Each of these methods is likely to tap into different but important parts of people’s social environment. Thus far, the development and implementation of these methods have occurred mostly separately from each other. Objective: Our aim was to synthesize the literature on how these methods are currently used to capture the changing social environment in relation to well-being and assess how to best combine these methods to study well-being. Methods: We conducted a scoping review according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: We included 275 studies. In total, 3 important points follow from our review. First, each method captures a different but important part of the social environment at a different temporal resolution. Second, measures are rarely validated (\&gt;70\% of ESM studies and 50\% of passive sensing studies were not validated), which undermines the robustness of the conclusions drawn. Third, a combination of methods is currently lacking (only 15/275, 5.5\% of the studies combined ESM and passive sensing, and no studies combined all 3 methods) but is essential in understanding well-being. Conclusions: We highlight that the practice of using poorly validated measures hampers progress in understanding the relationship between the changing social environment and well-being. We conclude that different methods should be combined more often to reduce the participants’ burden and form a holistic perspective on the social environment.},

This study aimed to examine the within-person link between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and depressed affect in everyday life. Methods Within an intensive longitudinal approach, adolescents (N = 72; 37\% young women; M age = 17.36 years; age range: 12–26 years; mid-90\% age range: 13–22 years) wore accelerometers to assess their daily MVPA and reported next-morning and same-evening depressed affect in diaries over eight consecutive days. The within-person link between MVPA and depressed affect on the next morning (time-lagged prediction) and the same evening (same-day link) was analyzed with mixed-effects models. Results More-than-usual MVPA significantly predicted less next-morning depressed affect on weekdays in young women, to the extent that a 60-min increase in MVPA over the person mean significantly predicted 50 per cent lower next-morning depressed affect. Conclusions This study encourages the development of individually tailored physical activity interventions that could help adolescents enhance their daily amount of unstructured, self-initiated MVPA to reduce depressed affect. This approach may be particularly suitable for young women who have the highest risk for an inactive lifestyle and elevated depressed affect.},

  abstract = {In psychology, the use of portable technology and wearable devices to ease participant burden in data collection is on the rise. This creates increased interest in collecting real-time or near real-time data from individuals within their natural environments. As a result, vast amounts of observational time series data are generated. Often, motivation for collecting this data hinges on understanding within-person processes that underlie psychological phenomena. Motivated by the body of Dr. Peter Molenaar’s life work calling for analytical approaches that consider potential heterogeneity and non-ergodicity, the focus of this paper is on using idiographic analyses to generate population inferences for within-person processes. Meta-analysis techniques using one-stage and two-stage random effects meta-analysis as implemented in single-case experimental designs are presented. The case for preferring a two-stage approach for meta-analysis of single-subject observational time series data is made and demonstrated using an empirical example. This provides a novel implementation of the methodology as prior implementations focus on applications to short time series with experimental designs. Inspired by Dr. Molenaar’s work, we describe how an approach, two-stage random effects meta-analysis (2SRE-MA), aligns with recent calls to consider idiographic approaches when making population-level inferences regarding within-person processes.},

Therefore, this study has the following two aims. First, to evaluate person-specific and pooled prediction models for binge eating (BE), alcohol use and binge drinking (BD) in daily life. Second, to identify important predictors for these behaviors.  Methods: A total of 120 patients (BN: 50; AUD: 51; BN/AUD: 19) participated in an experience sampling study, where over a period of 12 months they reported on their eating and drinking behaviors as well as on several other emotional, behavioral and contextual factors in daily life. The study had a burst-measurement design, where assessments occurred 8 times a day on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays in 7 bursts of 3 weeks. Afterwards, person-specific and pooled models were fit with elastic net regularized regression and evaluated with cross-validation. From these models, the variables with the 10\% highest estimates were identified.  Results: The person-specific models had a median AUC of 0.61, 0.80, and 0.85 for BE, alcohol use and BD respectively, while the pooled models had a median AUC of 0.70, 0.90, and 0.93. The most important predictors across the different behaviors were craving, and time of day. However, predictors concerning social context and affect differed between BE, alcohol use and BD. Conclusion: This study shows that BE, alcohol use and BD can be predicted in daily life, but that pooled models outperformed person-specific models and that models for alcohol use and BD outperformed those for BE. Future studies should investigate how model performance can be improved and how these models can be used to deliver interventions in daily life.},

This difference is generally interpreted as bias towards salient experiences in RA. During RA, participants are often asked to summarize their experiences in unspecific terms, which may indeed facilitate bias. At least in this unspecific form, the summary that participants apply to their remembered experiences can take many different forms.  In this study, we reanalyzed an existing dataset (N = 92) using a repeated N = 1 approach. We reported on interindividual differences between EMA data and RA score, and assessed for each participant whether it was likely that their RA score was an approximation of the mean of their experiences as captured by their EMA data.  We found considerable interpersonal differences in the difference between EMA scores and RA scores, as well as some extreme cases. Furthermore, for a considerable part of the sample (n = 46 for positive affect, n = 60 for negative affect), we did not reject the null hypothesis that their RA score represented the mean of their experiences as captured by their EMA data. We conclude that in its current unspecific form, RA may facilitate bias, although not for everyone. Future studies may determine whether more specific forms of RA reduce bias, while acknowledging interindividual differences.},

In this field, EMA/ERA-data-driven summaries are presented to participants with the goal of promoting their insight in their experiences. Underlying this procedure are some fundamental assumptions about (i) the relation between true moment-to-moment experiences and retrospective evaluations of those experiences, (ii) the translation of these experiences and evaluations to different types of data, (iii) the comparison of these different types of data, and (iv) the impact of a summary of moment-to-moment experiences on retrospective evaluations of those experiences.

  abstract = {Subjectively experienced sleep patterns often differ from observed sleeping behavior in insomniacs. Sleep patterns have been evaluated by measurements of motor activity in healthy subjects and insomniacs, but results may depend on the insomnia subtype. Sleep disturbances are frequent complaints in depression, but the influence of psychopathology on activity measurements remains elusive. Therefore, the relationship between reported sleep complaints and motor activity was studied in patients with major depression. Severity of depression was documented in depressed inpatients by observer- (HAMD) and self-rated scales (DACL, SHAPS-D). Self-reports of sleep were obtained by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and daily sleep logs (DSL). Motor activity was continuously recorded over 72 h by actigraphy. Good sleepers showed less motor activity during the night compared to poor sleepers (p{$<$}0.01). Patients with high HAMD scores (≥18) showed greater nocturnal motor activity and less sleep quality compared to patients with low HAMD scores (p{$<$}0.01). When controlling for age and severity of depression, partial correlation was found to be significant between perceived daily sleep quality and nocturnal motor activity (r=−0.63, p{$<$}0.01). There was a significant effect of nocturnal motor activity as a covariate on disturbances of subjective sleep quality and severity of depression as the main effect (p{$<$}0.01). In depressed patients, nocturnal motor activity seems to be an indicator of experienced sleep disturbances. The results warrant further controlled studies to evaluate the role of psychological factors for objective measurements and subjective perception of sleep patterns.},

However, traditional accounts of theoretical virtues, focused on their epistemic justification, have not yet proven informative to theory development in these fields. We advance a problem-centric, or pragmatic, account by which theoretical virtues are heuristics we use to estimate the degree to which a theory increases the problem-solving efficacy of a field's body of knowledge. From this perspective, what are traditionally considered epistemic virtues can be couched in terms of their coverage of problems in a field's domain, or problem-space, and additional virtues come to light that reflect a theory’s ability to facilitate its use by problem-having agents and its context in a societally-embedded scientific system. This approach helps us understand why the different needs of different fields result in different kinds of theories, and allows us to formulate the challenges facing cognitive science in terms that we hope will facilitate their resolution through further theoretical development.},

  abstract = {Eating disorders (EDs) are serious psychiatric illnesses with high mortality and societal cost. Despite their severity, there are few evidence-based treatments, and only 50\% of individuals respond to existing treatments. This low response rate may be due to the fact that EDs are highly heterogeneous disorders. Precision treatments are needed that can intervene on individual maintenance factors. The first step in such treatment development is identification of central treatment targets, both at the group (i.e., on average) and individual level. The current study (N = 102 individuals with an ED) utilized intensive longitudinal data to model several types of group-level and individual network models. Overall, we identified several group-level central symptoms, with the most common central symptoms of fear of weight gain, desire for thinness, feeling like one is overeating, thinking about dieting, and feeling guilty. We also found that these symptoms, specifically fear of weight gain, a desire to be thinner, thinking about dieting, feeling like one is overeating, and feeling guilty, predicted ED severity at a 1- and 6-month follow-up. We modeled 97 individual networks and found that central symptoms were highly heterogeneous, regardless of ED diagnosis. This work adds to the growing literature using intensive longitudinal data to model ED pathology and implicates fear of weight gain, thinking about dieting, and feelings of guilt as symptoms needing further treatment development work. Additionally, this work contributes essential knowledge on how group and individual network modeling can be used to conceptualize the maintenance of EDs on average and at the individual level.

  abstract = {Eating disorders (EDs) are severe mental illnesses, with high morbidity, mortality, and societal burden. EDs are extremely heterogenous, and only 50\% of patients currently respond to first-line treatments. Personalized and effective treatments for EDs are drastically needed. The current study (N = 34 participants with an ED diagnosis collected throughout the United States) aimed to investigate best methods informing how to select personalized treatment targets utilizing idiographic network analysis, which could then be used for evidence based personalized treatment development. We present initial data collected via experience sampling (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) over the course of 15 days, 5 times a day (75 total measurement points) that were used to select treatment targets for a personalized treatment for EDs. Overall, we found that treatment targets were highly variable, with less than 50\% of individuals endorsing central symptoms related to weight and shape, consistent with current treatment response rates for treatments designed to target those symptoms. We also found that different aspects of selection methods (e.g., number of items, type of centrality measure) impacted treatment target selection. We discuss implications of these data, how to use idiographic network analysis to personalize treatment, and identify areas that need future research. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04183894. Registered 3 December 2019—Retrospectively registered, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04183894. NCT04183894 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier). Eating disorders are severe psychiatric illnesses that carry high mortality, morbidity, and societal and personal burden. Treatments for eating disorders only work in 50\% of patients, signifying a great need to improve treatments. One reason that treatments may not work, is because eating disorders vary substantially from one individual to the next, which existing treatments do not fully consider. The current study (N = 34 participants with an eating disorder diagnosis) uses a new modeling technique to identify which symptoms should be targeted in treatment in a personalized manner. As expected, we found that, using this modeling technique, symptoms that should be targeted in treatment vary considerably. We discuss how to use this modeling technique to identify individual treatment targets and ways in which the field can use this strategy to improve existing and create new treatments.},

Meta-analysis of 36 studies (3,158 patients) suggested that patients with secure attachment pretreatment show better psychotherapy outcome than insecurely attached patients. Further, improvements in attachment security during therapy may coincide with better treatment outcome. Finally, preliminary moderator analyses suggest that those who experience low pretreatment attachment security may find better treatment outcome in therapy that incorporates a focus on interpersonal interactions and close relationships.

Modern psychotherapy research, plagued by the omnipresent “dodo bird” that has consistently determined that most psychotherapy modalities appear to have similar levels of effectiveness, has moved toward attempting to understanding mechanisms of change underlying treatment outcomes. Delineating the ways in which attachment theory may form the foundation for psychotherapy processes may help answer the call for change mechanisms and common therapeutic factors. In this article, we outline attachment theory as it applies to both children and adults, focusing specifically on its relevance for psychotherapy, followed by a review of the current empirical findings regarding the connection between attachment and psychotherapy. Finally, we highlight a series of existing psychotherapeutic modalities and techniques that are relevant for understanding the relationship between these domains and extend these examples to other forms of psychotherapy and psychotherapy process more broadly. Attachment provides a comprehensive yet parsimonious foundation for psychotherapy research and practice, with implications for enhancing treatments, personalizing care, and explaining the process of psychotherapeutic change.

Attachment organization was assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview and the RF coding scale. After 12 months of treatment, participants showed a significant increase in the number classified secure with respect to attachment state of mind for TFP but not for the other 2 treatments. Significant changes in narrative coherence and RF were found as a function of treatment, with TFP showing increases in both constructs during treatment. No changes in resolution of loss or trauma were observed across treatments. Findings suggest that 1 year of intensive TFP can increase patients' narrative coherence and RF.

We show that mixed effects random forests outperform standard random forests and personal average baselines when predicting clinical Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores (HDRS17). Compared to the latter baseline, accuracy is significantly improved for each patient by an average of 0.199-0.276 in terms of mean absolute error (p ≪ 0.05). This is noteworthy as these simple baselines frequently outperform machine learning methods in mental health prediction tasks. We suggest that this improved performance results from the ability of the mixed effects random forest to personalise model parameters to individuals in the dataset. However, we find that these improvements pertain exclusively to scenarios where labelled patient data are available to the model at training time. Investigating methods that improve accuracy when generalising to new patients is left as important future work.},

For example, Lakens et~al. and Lakens and Harms use this approach to study if there is a prespecified meaningful treatment effect in gerontology and clinical trials, instead of a point null hypothesis of any effect. Two popular Bayesian approaches are available for interval null hypothesis testing. One is the standard Bayes factor and the other is the region of practical equivalence (ROPE) procedure championed by Kruschke and others over many years. This article connects key quantities in the two approaches, which in turn allow us to contrast two major differences between the approaches with substantial practical implications. The first is that the Bayes factor depends heavily on the prior specification while a modified ROPE procedure is very robust. The second difference is concerned with the statistical property when data are generated under a neutral parameter value on the common boundary of competing hypotheses. In this case, the Bayes factors can be severely biased whereas the modified ROPE approach gives a reasonable result. Finally, the connection leads to a simple and effective algorithm for computing Bayes factors using draws from posterior distributions generated by standard Bayesian programs such as BUGS, JAGS, and Stan.},

To this end, our approach has better interpretability compared to other black-box forecasting combination schemes. We apply our framework to stock market data and M3 competition data.

High-dimensional and other complex variations of mlVAR models, though often computationally intractable in the frequentist framework, can be readily handled using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques in a Bayesian framework. However, researchers in social science fields may be unfamiliar with ways to capitalize on recent developments in Bayesian software programs. In this paper, we provide step-by-step illustrations and comparisons of options to fit Bayesian mlVAR models using Stan, JAGS and Mplus, supplemented with a Monte Carlo simulation study. An empirical example is used to demonstrate the utility of mlVAR models in studying intra- and inter-individual variations in affective dynamics.},

Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes, from information spreading to accessibility, by disrupting network paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature, we ask: Are there any advantages of the networks’ temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal networks can, compared to their static counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and have control trajectories, that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static networks.

  abstract = {In intensive longitudinal designs individuals are measured with high frequency over time. Sometimes there are multiple bursts of measurement, yielding multi-phase longitudinal data, which allow for evaluation of behavioral change at multiple timescales. From a systems theory perspective, a process that exhibits change occurring simultaneously at multiple time scales is non-stationary. Although recent methodological developments, such as dynamic systems models with time-varying parameters, have the capacity of handling non-stationarity, a more comprehensive framework may be needed for better analyzing multi-subject and multi-phase (interrupted) time series data.  In this study, we propose a Bayesian growth of hierarchical autoregression (GoHiAR) model, which combines autoregressive (AR) and growth curve models (GCM) to simultaneously evaluate developmental changes in multifaceted dynamic characteristics (e.g., baseline, variability, and regulation) of psychological processes as well as individual differences in these changes. We applied the proposed model  to an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study that had an mHealth intervention phase to investigate changes of dynamic characteristics of psychological well-being process, specifically in meaning of life. Findings suggested that participants generally experienced decreased fluctuation and increased regulation of meaning of life over the course of the intervention, but the mHealth intervention did not result in credible added benefit.},

These distinctions in how we understand positive psychology are then used to shape conceptions of possible futures for positive psychology. In conclusion, we identify several pertinent issues for the consideration of positive psychology as it moves forward.

Yet, sparse research has examined temporal relationships between sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, and psychological factors implicated in suicide, such as entrapment. This is the first in-the-moment investigation of relationships between suicidal ideation, objective and subjective sleep parameters, and perceptions of entrapment. Methods. Fifty-one participants with current suicidal ideation completed week-long ecological momentary assessments. An actigraph watch was worn for the duration of the study, which monitored total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and sleep latency. Daily sleep diaries captured subjective ratings of the same sleep parameters, with the addition of sleep quality. Suicidal ideation and entrapment were measured at six quasi-random time points each day. Multi-level random intercept models and moderation analyses were conducted to examine the links between sleep, entrapment, and suicidal ideation, adjusting for anxiety and depression severity. Results. Analyses revealed a unidirectional relationship whereby short sleep duration (both objective and subjective measures), and poor sleep quality, predicted the higher severity of next-day suicidal ideation. However, there was no significant association between daytime suicidal ideation and sleep the following night. Sleep quality moderated the relationship between pre-sleep entrapment and awakening levels of suicidal ideation. Conclusions. This is the first study to report night-to-day relationships between sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, and entrapment. Findings suggest that sleep quality may alter the strength of the relationship between pre-sleep entrapment and awakening suicidal ideation. Clinically, results underscore the importance of assessing and treating sleep disturbance when working with those experiencing suicidal ideation.},

  abstract = {With the increased use of time series data in human research, ranging from ecological momentary assessments to data passively obtained, researchers can explore dynamic processes more than ever before. An important question researchers must ask themselves is, do I think all individuals have similar processes? If not, how different, and in what ways? Dr. Peter Molenaar’s work set the foundation to answer these questions by providing insight into individual-level analysis for processes that are assumed to differ across individuals in at least some aspects. Currently, such assumptions do not have a clear taxonomy regarding the degree of homogeneity in the patterns of relations among variables and the corresponding parameter values. This paper provides the language with which researchers can discuss assumptions inherent in their analyses. We define strict homogeneity as the assumption that all individuals have an identical pattern of relations as well as parameter values; pattern homogeneity assumes the same pattern of relations but parameter values can differ; weak homogeneity assumes there are some (but not all) generalizable aspects of the process; and no homogeneity explicitly assumes no population-level similarities in dynamic processes across individuals. We demonstrate these assumptions with an empirical data set of daily emotions in couples.},

  abstract = {The measurement efficiency of a multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) can be improved by taking the correlations between the dimensions into account during the item selection and latent-trait estimation procedures (Segall, 1996; Wang \& Chen, 2004). Although a multidimensional computerized classification test (MCCT), which was based on a multidimensional itemresponse model, was previously found more efficient than its unidimensional counterpart, the difference was negligible (Seitz \& Frey, 2013); the researchers had adopted a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) as the termination criterion in this MCCT study. To make a classification decision on each dimension, which is called a grid classification (Wang et al., 2019), only items that loaded on that dimension were used to calculate the likelihood ratio, which squandered the available information of the correlations between the dimensions. The current study utilizes such useful information to improve the measurement efficiency of the MCCT by applying a conditional distribution of the latent-trait estimates and then including all the administered items to calculate the likelihood ratio in the SPRT. The performance of this newly proposed method was evaluated through a series of simulation studies. The results showed that the proposed method can sizably improve the measurement efficiency of an MCCT by saving 1\% to 32\% of the test length in comparison with the SPRT when the two test dimensions are at least moderately correlated. The findings and further applications of this study are discussed.},

Researchers are often interested in examining how these random effects predict outcome variables that vary across individuals. This can be done via a two-step approach in which empirical Bayes (EB) estimates of the random effects are extracted and then treated as observed predictor variables in follow-up regression analyses. This approach ignores the unreliability of EB estimates, leading to underestimation of regression coefficients. As such, previous studies have recommended a multilevel structural equation modeling (ML-SEM) approach that treats random effects as latent variables. The current study uses simulation and empirical data to show that a bias–variance tradeoff exists when selecting between the two approaches. ML-SEM produces generally unbiased regression coefficient estimates but also larger standard errors, which can lead to lower power than the two-step approach. Implications of the results for model selection and alternative solutions are discussed.},

Monte Carlo results indicate that (1) the 2moME model yields more accurate estimates of the parameters than the conventional moME model; (2) the 95\% credibility interval following the 2moME model covers the moME effects and the ESs more accurately than that following the conventional moME model; and (3) statistical tests for the existence of the moME effects with the 2moME model are more reliable in controlling type I errors than those with the conventional moME model, especially under heteroscedasticity conditions. In addition, the developed measures of ES are more interpretable, and directly answer the questions regarding the extent to which a moderator can account for the change of the mediation effect between the predictor and the outcome variable through the mediator variable. An empirical example illustrates the application of the 2moME model and the ES measures.},

In this article, we use statistical theory and simulated data to show that EB estimates are biased toward zero, a phenomenon known as “shrinkage.” The degree of shrinkage and reliability of EB estimates depend on a number of factors, including Level-1 residual variance, Level-1 predictor variance, Level-2 random effects variance, and number of within-person observations. As a result, EB estimates may not be ideal for detecting outliers, and they produce biased regression coefficients when used as predictors.

However, the typically short time series in psychological studies can lead to overfitting of VAR models, impairing their predictive ability on unseen samples. Cross-validation (CV) methods are commonly recommended for assessing the predictive ability of statistical models. However, it is unclear how the performance of CV is affected by characteristics of time series data and the fitted models. In this simulation study, we examine the ability of two CV methods, namely,10-fold CV and blocked CV, in estimating the prediction errors of three time series models with increasing complexity (person-mean, AR, and VAR), and evaluate how their performance is affected by data characteristics. We then compare these CV methods to the traditional methods using the Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) information criteria in their accuracy of selecting the most predictive models. We find that CV methods tend to underestimate prediction errors of simpler models, but overestimate prediction errors of VAR models, particularly when the number of observations is small. Nonetheless, CV methods, especially blocked CV, generally outperform the AIC and BIC. We conclude our study with a discussion on the implications of the findings and provide helpful guidelines for practice.},

  abstract = {hen multiple mediators exist on the causal pathway from treatment to outcome, path analysis prevails for disentangling indirect effects along paths linking possibly several mediators. However, separately evaluating each indirect effect along different posited paths demands stringent assumptions, such as correctly specifying the mediators’ causal structure, and no unobserved confounding among the mediators. These assumptions may be unfalsifiable in practice and, when they fail to hold, can result in misleading conclusions about the mediators. Nevertheless, these assumptions are avoidable when substantive interest is in inference about the indirect effects specific to each distinct mediator. In this article, we introduce a new definition of indirect effects called interventional indirect effects from the causal inference and epidemiology literature. Interventional indirect effects can be unbiasedly estimated without the assumptions above while retaining scientifically meaningful interpretations. We show that under a typical class of linear and additive mean models, estimators of interventional indirect effects adopt the same analytical form as prevalent product-of-coefficient estimators assuming a parallel mediator model. Prevalent estimators are therefore unbiased when estimating interventional indirect effects—even when there are unknown causal effects among the mediators—but require a different causal interpretation. When other mediators moderate the effect of each mediator on the outcome, and the mediators’ covariance is affected by treatment, such an indirect effect due to the mediators’ mutual dependence (on one another) cannot be attributed to any mediator alone. We exploit the proposed definitions of interventional indirect effects to develop novel estimators under such settings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, we notice important differences between the competition challenge and the challenges we face in a large e-commerce company. The datasets in our scenario are larger (hundreds of thousands of time series), and e-commerce can afford to have a larger assortment than brick-and-mortar retailers, leading to more intermittent data. To scale to larger dataset sizes with feasible computational effort, firstly, we investigate a two-layer hierarchy and propose a top-down approach to forecasting at an aggregated level with less amount of series and intermittency, and then disaggregating to obtain the decision-level forecasts. Probabilistic forecasts are generated under distributional assumptions. Secondly, direct training at the lower level with subsamples can also be an alternative way of scaling. Performance of modelling with subsets is evaluated with the main dataset. Apart from a proprietary dataset, the proposed scalable methods are evaluated using the Favorita dataset and the M5 dataset. We are able to show the differences in characteristics of the e-commerce and brick-andmortar retail datasets. Notably, our top-down forecasting framework enters the top 50 of the original M5 competition, even with models trained at a higher level under a much simpler setting.},

  abstract = {The AR(1) model has been shown to outperform the general VAR(1) model on typical affective time series. Even in combination with a lasso penalty, the reduced VAR(1) model (VAR-lasso) is generally outperformed. A reason for the AR dominance is that the VAR-lasso selects models that are still too complex —the space of all possible VAR models includes simpler models but these are hard to select with a traditional lasso penalty. In this article, we propose a reparametrization of the VAR model by decomposing its transition matrix into a symmetric and antisymmetric component (denoted as SAD), allowing us to construct a hierarchy of meaningful signposts in the VAR model space ranging from simple to complex. The decomposition enables the lasso procedure to pick up qualitatively distinct dynamical features in a more targeted way (like relaxation, shearing, and oscillations); this procedure is called SAD-lasso. This leads to a more intuitive interpretation of the reduced models. By removing the antisymmetric component altogether, we obtain a subclass of symmetric VAR models that form a natural extension of the AR model with the same simple relaxation dynamics but allowing for interactions between the system components. We apply these reparametrized and constrained VAR models to 1,391 psychological time series of affect, and compare their predictive accuracy. This analysis indicates that the SAD-lasso is a better regularization technique than the VAR-lasso. Additionally, the results of an extensive simulation study suggest the existence of symmetric interactions for almost half of the time series considered in this article.},

  abstract = {Background Disturbed circadian rhythms have been associated with depression. New body-worn devices allow the objective recording of circadian parameters such as physical activity, skin temperature and sleep. The objective of this study was to investigate whether circadian skin temperature and circadian activity rhythms are altered in depressed individuals. Methods Data on skin temperature, physical activity and sleep were available for 1610 subjects from a population-based cohort study. In a matching process two groups were formed for analysis: 121 participants with pronounced depression symptoms (CES-D Score\,{$>$}\,21) and n\,=\,121 matched non-depressed controls (CES-D Score\,{$<$}\,15). Circadian rhythms were investigated by analyzing non-parametric rhythm indicators of 24-h skin temperature and physical activity data. Sleep timing, continuity and quantity were calculated from actigraphy. Results No differences between the groups were found when all participants were considered. After excluding antidepressant medicated participants, the depression group was found to have a lower skin temperature amplitude t(208)\,=\,2.45, p\,=\,.015 and a less stable skin temperature rhythm t(208)\,=\,2.40, p\,=\,.017. The amplitude predicted the group status (beta\,=\,−5.529, p\,=\,.016). No effects were found for activity or sleep. Conclusion The results indicate that skin-temperature rhythms are blunted in unmedicated depressed individuals. This could be a promising non-invasive marker for further analysis.},

Symbole verwandeln sich dabei in Klischees. Die vom Verdrängungsprozeß erfaßten Symbole werden aus der (allgemein-)verständlichen Kommunikation ausgeklammert und privatsprachlich »formuliert«.

  abstract = {Objectives The melancholic and atypical specifiers for a major depressive episode (MDE) are supposed to reduce heterogeneity in symptom presentation by requiring additional, specific features. Fried et al. (2020) recently showed that the melancholic specifier may increase the potential heterogeneity in presenting symptoms. In a large sample of outpatients with depression, our objective was to explore whether the melancholic and atypical specifiers reduced observed heterogeneity in symptoms. Methods We used baseline data from the Inventory of Depression Symptoms (IDS), which was available for 3,717 patients, from the Sequenced Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial. A subsample met criteria for MDE on the IDS (“IDS-MDE”; N =2,496). For patients with IDS-MDE, we differentiated between those with melancholic, non-melancholic, non-melancholic, atypical, and non-atypical depression. We quantified the observed heterogeneity between groups by counting the number of unique symptom combinations pertaining to their given diagnostic group (e.g., counting the melancholic symptoms for melancholic and non-melancholic groups), as well as the profiles of DSM-MDE symptoms (i.e., ignoring the specifier symptoms). Results When considering the specifier and depressive symptoms, there was more observed heterogeneity within the melancholic and atypical subgroups than in the IDS-MDE sample (i.e., ignoring the specifier subgroups). The differences in number of profiles between the melancholic and non-melancholic groups were not statistically significant, irrespective of whether focusing on the specifier symptoms or only the DSM-MDE symptoms. The differences between the atypical and non-atypical subgroups were smaller than what would be expected by chance. We found no evidence that the specifier groups reduce heterogeneity, as can be quantified by unique symptom profiles. Most symptom profiles, even in the specifier subgroups, had five or fewer individuals. Conclusion We found no evidence that the atypical and melancholic specifiers create more symptomatically homogeneous groups. Indeed, the melancholic and atypical specifiers introduce heterogeneity by adding symptoms to the DSM diagnosis of MDE.},

  abstract = {Background: Insomnia has become a major public health concern. Aims: The study examined the efficacy of a web-based unguided self-help programme with automated feedback. The programme was based on cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). The investigation particularly focused on factors that contribute to the maintenance of insomnia and tested whether treatment effects were stable over a period of 12 months. Method: Fifty-six participants were randomly assigned either to web-based CBT-I or to the waiting-list control group. Included measures assessed insomnia severity, sleep-related cognitions, safety behaviours, depression, anxiety and somatization. In the intervention group, a sleep diary was used to assess sleep continuity parameters, sleep quality and daytime performance. Results: Large between- and within-group effect sizes (d = 1.79, d = 1.59) for insomnia severity were found. The treatment group effect remained stable over the period of 12 months. Further, sleep-related cognitions, safety behaviours, depression and somatization significantly decreased in the treatment group compared with the control group. On all sleep diary parameters, medium to large effects were revealed within the treatment group. Anxiety did not decrease significantly from pre- to post-assessment. For all measures except somatization and anxiety significant within-group effects were found at 12-month follow-up assessment indicating long-lasting effects. Conclusions: This study adds evidence to the literature on unguided online interventions for insomnia, and indicates that online CBT-I can have substantial long-term effects on relevant sleep-related outcome parameters. Moreover, the results indicate that sleep-related cognitions and safety behaviour can be successfully altered with an unguided CBT-I intervention.},

In particular, it is unknown whether changes in depression core symptoms precede or follow changes in sleep, and whether a longer or shorter sleep duration is related to improvements of depression core symptoms. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate temporal associations between sleep and depression in patients suffering from major depressive disorder using an idiographic research approach. Methods: Time-series data of daily sleep assessments (time in bed and total sleep time) and self-rated depression core symptoms for an average of 173 days per patient were analyzed in 22 patients diagnosed with recurrent major depressive disorder using a vector autoregression model. Granger causality tests were conducted to test for possible causality. Impulse response analysis and forecast error variance decomposition were performed to quantify the temporal mutual impact of sleep and depression. Results: Overall, 11 positive and 5 negative associations were identified between time in bed/total sleep time and depression core symptoms. Granger analysis showed that time in bed/total sleep time caused depression core symptoms in 9 associations, whereas this temporal order was reversed for the other 7 associations. Most of the variance (10\%) concerning depression core symptoms could be explained by time in bed. Changes in sleep or depressive symptoms of 1 SD had the greatest impact on the other variable in the following 2 to 4 days. Conclusions: Longer rather than shorter bedtimes were associated with more depression core symptoms. However, the temporal orders of the associations were heterogeneous.},

  abstract = {The generalized partially linear additive model (GPLAM) is a flexible and interpretable approach to building predictive models. It combines features in an additive manner, allowing each to have either a linear or nonlinear effect on the response. However, the choice of which features to treat as linear or nonlinear is typically assumed known. Thus, to make a GPLAM a viable approach in situations in which little is known priori about the features, one must overcome two primary model selection challenges: deciding which features to include in the model and determining which of these features to treat nonlinearly. We introduce the sparse partially linear additive model (SPLAM), which combines model fitting and both of these model selection challenges into a single convex optimization problem. SPLAM provides a bridge between the lasso and sparse additive models. Through a statistical oracle inequality and thorough simulation, we demonstrate that SPLAM can outperform other methods across a broad spectrum of statistical regimes, including the high-dimensional (p ≫ N) setting. We develop efficient algorithms that are applied to real datasets with half a million samples and over 45,000 features with excellent predictive performance.},

Criterion validity was established in a subsample of 520 participants with reference to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Sensitivity to change was investigated in a prospective study of 167 patients who completed the SCID both at baseline and the 1-year follow-up. Results With reference to the SCID, the PHQ-2 had a sensitivity of 87\% and a specificity of 78\% for major depressive disorder and a sensitivity of 79\% and a specificity of 86\% for any depressive disorder. Its diagnostic performance was comparable with that of longer depression scales. PHQ-2 change scores accurately reflected improved, unchanged, and deteriorated depression outcomes. Conclusion The PHQ-2 performed favorably with respect to a standard diagnostic interview, as well as established depression scales and proved sensitive to change. Thus, the PHQ-2 appears promising as a brief multipurpose measure for detecting depression, grading its severity, and monitoring outcomes over time.},

  abstract = {Results of simulation studies evaluating the performance of statistical methods are often considered actionable and thus can have a major impact on the way empirical research is implemented. However, so far there is limited evidence about the reproducibility and replicability of statistical simulation studies. Therefore, eight highly cited statistical simulation studies were selected, and their replicability was assessed by teams of replicators with formal training in quantitative methodology. The teams found relevant information in the original publications and used it to write simulation code with the aim of replicating the results. The primary outcome was the feasibility of replicability based on reported information in the original publications. Replicability varied greatly: Some original studies provided detailed information leading to almost perfect replication of results, whereas other studies did not provide enough information to implement any of the reported simulations. Replicators had to make choices regarding missing or ambiguous information in the original studies, error handling, and software environment. Factors facilitating replication included public availability of code, and descriptions of the data-generating procedure and methods in graphs, formulas, structured text, and publicly accessible additional resources such as technical reports. Replicability of statistical simulation studies was mainly impeded by lack of information and sustainability of information sources. Reproducibility could be achieved for simulation studies by providing open code and data as a supplement to the publication. Additionally, simulation studies should be transparently reported with all relevant information either in the research paper itself or in easily accessible supplementary material to allow for replicability.},

  abstract = {Inspired by modeling approaches from the ecosystems literature, in this paper, we expand the network approach to psychopathology with risk and protective factors to arrive at an integrated analysis of resilience. We take a complexity approach to investigate the multifactorial nature of resilience and present a system in which a network of interacting psychiatric symptoms is targeted by risk and protective factors. These risk and protective factors influence symptom development patterns and thereby increase or decrease the probability that the symptom network is pulled toward a healthy or disorder state. In this way, risk and protective factors influence the resilience of the network. We take a step forward in formalizing the proposed system by implementing it in a statistical model and translating different influences from risk and protective factors to specific targets on the node and edge parameters of the symptom network. To analyze the behavior of the system under different targets, we present two novel network resilience metrics: Expected Symptom Activity (ESA, which indicates how many symptoms are active or inactive) and Symptom Activity Stability (SAS, which indicates how stable the symptom activity patterns are). These metrics follow standard practices in the resilience literature, combined with ideas from ecology and physics, and characterize resilience in terms of the stability of the system's healthy state. By discussing the advantages and limitations of our proposed system and metrics, we provide concrete suggestions for the further development of a comprehensive modeling approach to study the complex relationship between risk and protective factors and resilience.},

  abstract = {Researchers across varied fields increasingly are collecting and analyzing intensive longitudinal data (ILD) to examine processes across time at the individual level. Two types of relations are typically examined: lagged and contemporaneous. Lagged relations capture how variables at a prior time point can be used to explain variance in variables at a later time point. These are always modeled using auto- and cross-regressions by means of vector autoregression (VAR). By contrast, there are two types of relations commonly used to model the contemporaneous relations, which model how variables relate instantaneously. Until now, researchers must opt to either model contemporaneous relations as undirected relations among residuals (e.g., partial or full correlations) or as directed relations among the variables (e.g., paths or regressions). The choice for how to model contemporaneous relations has implications for inferences as well as the potential to introduce bias in the VAR lagged relations if the wrong type of relation is used. This article introduces a novel data-driven method, hybrid-group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME), that provides a solution to the problem of having to choose one or the other type of contemporaneous relation to model. The modeling framework utilized in hybrid-GIMME allows for both types of contemporaneous relations in addition to the standard VAR relations. Both simulated and empirical data were used to test the performance of hybrid-GIMME. Results suggest this is a robust method for recovering contemporaneous relations in an exploratory manner, particularly with an ample number of time points per person.

Using a smartphone-based ambulatory assessment design, this study examined the duration of the effects of three types of activities (i.e., sociocognitive, passive leisure, and physical activities) on working memory performance. For seven times per day (i.e., approximately every 2 hr) over 15 days, 150 healthy older adults (aged 65–91 years) in Switzerland reported their present activities and completed working memory assessments. In an examination of within-person concurrent associations, results from a multilevel model showed that passive leisure activities were negatively associated with working memory. Extending this to time-lagged dynamics, results from multilevel vector autoregression models showed that the negative effect of passive leisure activities and a positive effect of sociocognitive activities on working memory performance appeared 6 hr later and faded out completely by 8 hr later. Follow-up analyses showed that the time-lagged effects of activity engagement were evident among relatively younger individuals with lower levels of formal education. In sum, our findings suggest that a single bout of activity engagement has an impact on cognitive performance as quickly as 6 hr. In line with the 'use it or lose it' hypothesis, our findings highlight the importance of continuous and active engagement in sociocognitive activities in older age.

Methods: Data of 349 outpatients and 44 therapists in private practices were used. Separate multilevel analyses were conducted to estimate predictors and feedback and therapist effects. Results: Around 5.88\% of the variability in treatment outcome and 8.89\% in treatment length were attributed to therapists. There was no relationship between the average effectiveness of therapists and the average length of their treatments. Initial impairment, early alliance, number of diagnoses, feedback as well as therapists’ and patients’ attitudes toward feedback were significant predictors of treatment outcome. Treatments tended to be longer for patients with a higher number of approved sessions by the insurance company, with higher levels of interpersonal distress at intake, and for those who developed negatively (negative feedback) over the course of their treatment. Conclusions: Therapist effects on treatment outcome and treatment length in routine care seem to be relevant predictors in the context of feedback studies. Therapists’ attitudes toward and use of feedback as well as patients’ attitudes toward feedback should be further investigated in future research on psychometric feedback.},

The recently emerged, innovative statistical tool of complex network analysis was used in the present proof-of-concept study to improve the prediction of attrition. Fifty-eight patients undergoing psychological treatment for mood or anxiety disorders were assessed using Ecological Momentary Assessments four times a day for two weeks before treatment (3,248 measurements). Multilevel vector autoregressive models were employed to compute dynamic symptom networks. Intake variables and network parameters (centrality measures) were used as predictors for dropout using machine-learning algorithms. Networks for patients differed significantly between completers and dropouts. Among intake variables, initial impairment and sex predicted dropout explaining 6\% of the variance. The network analysis identified four additional predictors: Expected force of being excited, outstrength of experiencing social support, betweenness of feeling nervous, and instrength of being active. The final model with the two intake and four network variables explained 32\% of variance in dropout and identified 47 out of 58 patients correctly. The findings indicate that patients’ dynamic network structures may improve the prediction of dropout. When implemented in routine care, such prediction models could identify patients at risk for attrition and inform personalized treatment recommendations.},

In this article, I instead argue that formal modelling cannot solve the core problem the psychological ‘theory crisis’ refers to, which are the currently high degrees of contrastive and holistic underdetermination of our theories by our data. I do so by first introducing underdetermination as an explanatory framework for determining the evidential import of research findings for theories, and showing how both broader theoretical considerations and informal assumptions are key to this process. Then, I derive the aforementioned core problem from current theory crisis literature and tentatively explore its possible solutions. Lastly, I show that formal modelling is neither a necessary nor sufficient solution for either contrastive or holistic underdetermination, and that its uncritical adoption might instead worsen the crisis.},

  abstract = {From an evolutionary perspective, a central mechanism promoting infant survival is the maintenance of proximity to attachment figures. Consequently attachment figure(s) represent the infant's primary solution to experiences of fear. Aspects of the development of the field of attachment are outlined within this context, beginning with Bowlby's ethological/evolutionary theory, and proceeding to Ainsworth's early descriptions of infant-mother interaction in Uganda and Baltimore. Using a laboratory procedure called the strange situation, Ainsworth identified three organized patterns of infant response to separation from and reunion with the parent. Narratives derived from videotaped strange situation behavior of infants in each category (secure, avoidant, and resistant/ambivalent) are provided, together with a discussion of the prototypical sequelae of each category (e.g., school behavior, and separation-related narratives and drawings at age six). The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and the move to the level of representation are also described. AAI transcripts are presently analyzed according to the speaker's capacity to adhere to Grice's maxims of rational cooperative discourse, and three organizedAAI categories, or states of mind with respect to attachment, have been identified (secure-autonomous, dismissing, and preoccupied). When the interview is administered to parents who have been seen with their infants in the strange situation, each AAI category has repeatedly been found to predict that infant's strange situation response to that parent. Illustrations of the discourse characteristic of each category are provided, and it is noted that individuals with apparently unfavorable life histories are found to have secure offspring, providing that their history is recounted coherently. Like infant strange situation behavior, differences in adult security as identified through discourse patterning are interpreted in terms of attentional flexibility or inflexibility under attachment-related stress.},

  abstract = {Research guided by attachment theory as formulated by Bowlby and Ainsworth is branching out in exciting new directions. The 12 chapters collected together in this Monograph present theoretical and methodological tools that will facilitate further research on attachment across the life span, across generations, and across cultures. The Monograph is divided into 4 parts. Part 1 provides the theoretical framework, emphasizing the ethological and the psychoanalytic roots of attachment theory. Two central ideas in attachment theory are highlighted: attachment as grounded in a behavioral-motivational control system whose set-goal is felt security, and the notion that individuals construct internal working models of self and attachment figures that guide the interpretation and production of behavior. These themes are repeatedly taken up in other chapters of the Monograph. Part 2 is concerned with translating theory into measurement. In Chapter II, Waters and Deane present a Q-sort suitable for assessing attachment security in 12-36-month-olds. This instrument is based on Bowlby's control systems model of attachment. In Chapter III, Main, Kaplan, and Cassidy offer a variety of highly original measures for assessing security in children and adults that have been validated against attachment classifications in infancy. These measures open new avenues for research by moving the study of attachment to the level of representation. Part 3 (Chaps. IV-IX) is organized around issues in adaptation, maladaptation, and intergenerational transmission. Vaughn, Deane, and Waters (Chap. IV) examine short-term and long-term adaptations to nonmaternal care. Findings on short-term adaptation to high-quality day care seemed benign; those on long-term adaptation illustrate that outcome is jointly dependent on attachment security and on whether or when the mother returns to work. In Chapter V, Dontas, Maratos, Fafoutis, and Karangelis present a field study, conducted in a model infant home in Greece, describing 8-12-month-olds' 2-week adaptations to a new principal caregiver (the adoptive mother) in a supportive setting. The theme of Chapters VI and VII is continuity of adaptation from infancy to early childhood in a poverty and in a middle-class sample. Significant relationships between early insecure attachment classification and later preschool behavior problems are reported for the poverty sample (Erickson, Sroufe, \& Egeland, Chap. VI) but not for the middle-class sample (Bates, Maslin, \& Frankel, Chap. VII), despite the fact that mother-infant interaction at 6, 13, and 24 months was related to attachment classifications in predictable ways. In Chapter VIII, Schneider-Rosen, Braunwald, Carlson, and Cicchetti discuss infants' adaption to maltreatment. They report a preponderance of insecure attachment classifications at 12, 18, and 24 months, with avoidant classifications becoming dominant at the later ages. Secure attachment in abused children is explained in terms of multifactorial compensatory and potentiating influences. In the concluding chapter of this section, Ricks reviews intergenerational effects related to attachment. Two domains are considered: effects of early separation and familial disruption on parental behavior in the next generation, and continuity in quality of attachment. Part 4 (Chaps. X-XII) is devoted to cross-national research on attachment in infancy. Grossmann, Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, and Unzner (Chap. X) present findings for North German mother-infant pairs, observed at home and in the Strange Situation. This first attempt at replicating the classic Baltimore study corroborated associations between Strange Situation classifications and maternal sensitivity to infant signals reported by Ainsworth and her colleagues. However, the overrepresentation of group A (avoidant) classifications in this sample is ascribed to a culturally valued emphasis on early independence rather than to maternal rejection. In Chapter XI, Sagi, Lamb, Lewkowicz, Shoham, Dvir, and Estes report a high proportion of insecure-resistant (C) classifications in 12-month-old Israeli kibbutz infants, who were observed with mother, father, and metapelet. This finding is explained in terms of heightened stranger anxiety rather than insecurity. A comparison group of Israeli city infants in day care resembled U.S. samples in terms of Strange Situation groups. The insecure-resistant group (C) was also overrepresented in Japan (Miyake, Chen, \& Campos, Chap. XII), where C classification was correlated with neonatal temperament but also with maternal interactive behavior. In view of the infants' lack of experience with nonfamilial care, the C classification in Japan is not interpreted as an index of insecure-resistant attachment. Two additional themes running through the Monograph deserve special mention. These are (a) a concern with epigenetic explanations, charting different developmental pathways for secure and insecure infants, and (b) consideration of exceptional cases that do not, at first sight, fit predictions derived from the epigenetic perspective.}

  abstract = {Depression is widely acknowledged to be a heterogeneous entity, and the need to further characterize the individual patient who has received this diagnosis in order to personalize the management plan has been repeatedly emphasized. However, the research evidence that should guide this personalization is at present fragmentary, and the selection of treatment is usually based on the clinician's and/or the patient's preference and on safety issues, in a trial-and-error fashion, paying little attention to the particular features of the specific case. This may be one of the reasons why the majority of patients with a diagnosis of depression do not achieve remission with the first treatment they receive. The predominant pessimism about the actual feasibility of the personalization of treatment of depression in routine clinical practice has recently been tempered by some secondary analyses of databases from clinical trials, using approaches such as individual patient data meta-analysis and machine learning, which indicate that some variables may indeed contribute to the identification of patients who are likely to respond differently to various antidepressant drugs or to antidepressant medication vs. specific psychotherapies. The need to develop decision support tools guiding the personalization of treatment of depression has been recently reaffirmed, and the point made that these tools should be developed through large observational studies using a comprehensive battery of self-report and clinical measures. The present paper aims to describe systematically the salient domains that should be considered in this effort to personalize depression treatment. For each domain, the available research evidence is summarized, and the relevant assessment instruments are reviewed, with special attention to their suitability for use in routine clinical practice, also in view of their possible inclusion in the above-mentioned comprehensive battery of measures. The main unmet needs that research should address in this area are emphasized. Where the available evidence allows providing the clinician with specific advice that can already be used today to make the management of depression more personalized, this advice is highlighted. Indeed, some sections of the paper, such as those on neurocognition and on physical comorbidities, indicate that the modern management of depression is becoming increasingly complex, with several components other than simply the choice of an antidepressant and/or a psychotherapy, some of which can already be reliably personalized.},

Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.},

  abstract = {Recent conceptualisations of resilience have advanced the notion that it is a dynamic and multifaceted construct. However, its adaptive components, especially those forged by adversity, have not been fully realised, and its neurobiological and psychosocial underpinnings are yet to be meaningfully integrated. In part, this is because a developmental perspective is often neglected in the formulation of resilience. In this review, we consider the findings of resilience research, with a specific emphasis on the developmental period of adolescence. To bridge the gaps in our current understanding, we propose a model of resilience that is predicated on experiencing adversity. Specifically, our model provides a sophisticated insight into the components of resilience, which, together with intrinsic features, involves facilitation of, and skill acquisition via strengthening processes we term tempering and fortification. The model also points to the potential trajectories of adversity-driven resilience and forms the basis of a framework that allows for individual variance in resilience, and the identification of both neurobiological and psychosocial targets for prevention and therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Context Given its high prevalence and impact on quality of life, more research is needed in identifying factors that may prevent depression. This review examined whether physical activity (PA) is protective against the onset of depression. Evidence acquisition A comprehensive search was conducted up until December 2012 in the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Data were analyzed between July 2012 and February 2013. Articles were chosen for the review if the study used a prospective-based, longitudinal design and examined relationships between PA and depression over at least two time intervals. A formal quality assessment for each study also was conducted independently by the two reviewers. Evidence synthesis The initial search yielded a total of 6363 citations. After a thorough selection process, 30 studies were included for analyses. Among these, 25 studies demonstrated that baseline PA was negatively associated with a risk of subsequent depression. The majority of these studies were of high methodologic quality, providing consistent evidence that PA may prevent future depression. There is promising evidence that any level of PA, including low levels (e.g., walking {$<$}150 minutes/weeks), can prevent future depression. Conclusions From a population health perspective, promoting PA may serve as a valuable mental health promotion strategy in reducing the risk of developing depression.},

  abstract = {Background There is interest in the use of very brief instruments to identify depression because of the advantages they offer in busy clinical settings. The PHQ-2, consisting of two questions relating to core symptoms of depression (low mood and loss of interest or pleasure), is one such instrument. Method A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that had assessed the diagnostic performance of the PHQ-2 to detect major depression. Embase, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and grey literature databases were searched. Reference lists of included studies and previous relevant reviews were also examined. Studies were included that used the standard scoring system of the PHQ-2, assessed its performance against a gold-standard diagnostic interview and reported data on its performance at the recommended (≥3) or an alternative cut-off point (≥2). After assessing heterogeneity, where appropriate, data from studies were combined using bivariate diagnostic meta-analysis to derive sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios. Results 21 studies met inclusion criteria totalling N=11,175 people out of which 1529 had major depressive disorder according to a gold standard. 19 of the 21 included studies reported data for a cut-off point of ≥3. Pooled sensitivity was 0.76 (95\% CI =0.68–0.82), pooled specificity was 0.87 (95\% CI =0.82–0.90). However there was substantial heterogeneity at this cut-off (I2=81.8\%). 17 studies reported data on the performance of the measure at cut-off point ≥2. Heterogeneity was I2=43.2\% pooled sensitivity at this cut-off point was 0.91 (95\% CI =0.85–0.94), and pooled specificity was 0.70 (95\% CI =0.64–0.76). Conclusion The generally lower sensitivity of the PHQ-2 at cut-off ≥3 than the original validation study (0.83) suggests that ≥2 may be preferable if clinicians want to ensure that few cases of depression are missed. However, in situations in which the prevalence of depression is low, this may result in an unacceptably high false-positive rate because of the associated modest specificity. These results, however, need to be interpreted with caution given the possibility of selectively reported cut-offs.},

  abstract = {Multivariate analysis using graphical models is rapidly gaining ground in psychology. In particular, Markov Random Field (MRF) graphical models have become popular because their graph structure reflects the conditional associations between psychological variables. Despite the fact that most psychological variables are assessed on an ordinal scale, the analysis of MRFs for ordinal variables has received little attention in the psychometric literature. To fill this gap, we present an MRF for ordinal data that so far has not been considered in network psychometrics. We present statistical methodology to test the structure of the proposed MRF, which requires us to determine the plausibility of the opposing hypotheses of conditional dependence and independence. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach using the inclusion Bayes factor to quantify the (lack of) evidence for a given edge. We use a Bayesian variable selection approach to model the inclusion and exclusion of edges in the network, and Bayesian model averaging to compare network structures with and without the given edge. We provide an implementation in the new R package bgms, evaluate its performance in simulations, and illustrate it with empirical data.},

  abstract = {The Ising model is a graphical model that has played an essential role in network psychometrics. It has been used as a theoretical model to conceptualize psychological concepts and as a statistical model to analyze psychological data. Using graphical models such as the Ising model to analyze psychological data has been heavily critiqued since these data often come from cross-sectional applications. An often voiced concern is the inability of the Ising model to express heterogeneity in the population. The idiographic approach has been posed as an alternative and aims to infer individual network structures. While idiographic networks overcome population heterogeneity, it is unclear how they aggregate into established cross-sectional phenomena. This paper establishes a formal bridge between idiographic and cross-sectional network approaches of the Ising model. We ascertain unique topological structures that characterize individuals and aggregate into an Ising model cross-sectionally. This new formulation supports population heterogeneity while being consistent with cross-sectional phenomena. The proposed theory also establishes a new statistical framework for analyzing populations of idiographic networks for binary variables. The Ising model and the divide and color model are special cases of this new framework. We introduce a Gibbs sampling algorithm to estimate models from this new framework.},

  abstract = {The Ising model is one of the most widely analyzed graphical models in network psychometrics. However, popular approaches to parameter estimation and structure selection for the Ising model cannot naturally express uncertainty about the estimated parameters or selected structures. To address this issue, this paper offers an objective Bayesian approach to parameter estimation and structure selection for the Ising model. Our methods build on a continuous spike-and-slab approach. We show that our methods consistently select the correct structure and provide a new objective method to set the spike-and-slab hyperparameters. To circumvent the exploration of the complete structure space, which is too large in practical situations, we propose a novel approach that first screens for promising edges and then only explore the space instantiated by these edges. We apply our proposed methods to estimate the network of depression and alcohol use disorder symptoms from symptom scores of over 26,000 subjects.},

A standard modeling approach that includes such sources of variability is the mixed-effects models (MEMs) with crossed random effects. However, under-parameterizing or over-parameterizing the random structure of MEMs bias the estimations of the Standard Errors (SEs) of fixed effects. In this simulation study, we examined two different but complementary perspectives: model selection with likelihood-ratio tests, AIC, and BIC; and model averaging with Akaike weights. Results showed that true model selection was constant across the different strategies examined (including ML and REML estimators). However, sample size and variance of random slopes were found to explain true model selection and SE bias of fixed effects. No relevant differences in SE bias were found for model selection and model averaging. Sample size and variance of random slopes interacted with the estimator to explain SE bias. Only the within-subjects effect showed significant underestimation of SEs with smaller number of items and larger item random slopes. SE bias was higher for ML than REML, but the variability of SE bias was the opposite. Such variability can be translated into high rates of unacceptable bias in many replications.},

Within this framework, Martin Seligman, a founder of positive psychology, offers an empirically-based argument for an ancient and venerable theme: happiness can be increased by exercising the virtues. Seligman's project is promising, but it needs to pay greater attention to several methodological matters: (1) greater care in defining happiness, so as to avoid smuggling in value assumptions of the sort suggested by the title of his book, Authentic Happiness; (2) more attention to the gap between happiness as overall satisfaction and specific gratifications (enjoyments); (3) the danger of sliding to subjectivism by equating self-assessments of virtue with objectively-justified values of the sort Aristotle had in mind; (4) awareness of how “positive” emotions and attitudes presuppose value assumptions.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic forecasting models describe the aleatory variability of natural systems as well as our epistemic uncertainty about how the systems work. Testing a model against observations exposes ontological errors in the representation of a system and its uncertainties. We clarify several conceptual issues regarding the testing of probabilistic forecasting models for ontological errors: the ambiguity of the aleatory/epistemic dichotomy, the quantification of uncertainties as degrees of belief, the interplay between Bayesian and frequentist methods, and the scientific pathway for capturing predictability. We show that testability of the ontological null hypothesis derives from an experimental concept, external to the model, that identifies collections of data, observed and not yet observed, that are judged to be exchangeable when conditioned on a set of explanatory variables. These conditional exchangeability judgments specify observations with well-defined frequencies. Any model predicting these behaviors can thus be tested for ontological error by frequentist methods; e.g., using P values. In the forecasting problem, prior predictive model checking, rather than posterior predictive checking, is desirable because it provides more severe tests. We illustrate experimental concepts using examples from probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. Severe testing of a model under an appropriate set of experimental concepts is the key to model validation, in which we seek to know whether a model replicates the data-generating process well enough to be sufficiently reliable for some useful purpose, such as long-term seismic forecasting. Pessimistic views of system predictability fail to recognize the power of this methodology in separating predictable behaviors from those that are not.},

Fifty-three individuals diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 53 never-depressed controls participated in a seven-day experience sampling study. Participants were prompted randomly eight times per day and answered questions about their physical activity and affective state. Over the week, the two groups of participants did not differ in average level of physical activity. As expected, participants with MDD reported lower average PA and higher average NA than did never-depressed controls. Both participants with MDD and controls reported higher levels of PA at prompts after physical activity than at prompts after inactive periods; moreover, for both groups of participants, PA increased from a prompt after an inactive period to a subsequent prompt at which activity was reported. Depressed participants in particular showed a dose-response effect of physical activity on affect: longer duration and/or higher intensity of physical activity increased their PA significantly more than did short duration and/or lower intensity physical activity. Physical activity did not influence NA in either group. In contrast to previous treatment studies that examined the effects of prescribed structured exercise, this investigation showed that self-initiated physical activity influences PA. These findings also underscore the importance of distinguishing between PA and NA to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of physical activity on affect in MDD.},

This study examined the use of actigraphy in the measurement of sleep of patients with depression and insomnia. Fifty-four patients diagnosed with a current major depressive episode and chronic insomnia underwent a baseline overnight study with concurrent actigraphic and polysomnography (PSG) monitoring, as well as subjective sleep diaries. Agreement between PSG, actigraphy and sleep diary measurements was evaluated using two-tailed t-tests, Pearson’s correlations and the Bland–Altman concordance technique. The only significant difference found between actigraphy and PSG was in latency to persistent sleep, in which actigraphy underestimated sleep latency relative to PSG (P {$<$} 0.05). There were moderate positive correlations between actigraphy and PSG for all variables. In contrast, significant differences were observed between sleep diaries and PSG for all sleep variables. Bland–Altman concordance diagrams also demonstrated that, while bias was limited between PSG and the other two measurement types, there were somewhat broad 95\% limits of agreement for all sleep variables with both sleep diaries and actigraphy. In summary, actigraphic measurements of sleep more closely approximated those of PSG than did sleep diaries in this sample of depressed insomniacs.},

No practical biomarkers presently exist to predict responsiveness to antidepressants. Herein we report pilot data for a rest-activity biomarker of antidepressant response., Fifty-eight medication-free adults with MDD underwent a week-long collection of actigraphic data before beginning a 9 week open label trial of fluoxetine, coupled with blinded randomized assignment to eszopiclone/placebo. Depression severity was repeatedly measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Baseline actigraphic data was analyzed with functional data analysis to create smoothed 24-hour curves of activity. The time of the lowest point of activity (the bathyphase) was calculated for each patient, as well the mean difference between bedtime and the bathyphase (BBD). At the end of treatment, patients were characterized as treatment responders (50\% reduction in HRSD) or non-responders, and receiver operating curves were calculated to find the optimal cut point of the BBD for prediction of treatment response., The best cut point for BBD was at 260.2 minutes, resulting in an effect size of 1.45, and with a positive predictive value of 0.75 and a negative predictive value of 0.88., We conclude that actigraphically-determined measures of rest-activity patterns show promise as potential biomarker predictors of antidepressant response. However, this conclusion is based upon a small number of patients who received only one choice of antidepressant, for a single trial. Replication with a larger sample is needed.},

  abstract = {Background Epidemiologic research suggests that physical activity is associated with decreased prevalence of depression. However, the relationship between physical activity accumulated in various domains and depression remains unclear. Further, previous population-based studies have predominantly utilized self-reported measures of physical activity and depression symptom subscales. Associations between physical activity in various domains (leisure, work, active commuting, yard/household) and depression were examined using both subjective and objective measures of physical activity and a diagnostic measure of depression. Methods Analyses (conducted in 2007) included data from 1995 young adults participating in a national study (2004–2006). Physical activity was measured by self-report (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) and objectively as pedometer steps/day. Depression (DSM-IV 12-month diagnosis of major depression or dysthymic disorder) was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results For women, moderate levels of ambulatory activity (≥7500 steps/day) were associated with ∼50\% lower prevalence of depression compared with being sedentary ({$<$}5000 steps/day) (p trend=0.005). Relatively low durations of leisure physical activity (≥1.25 hours/week) were associated with ∼45\% lower prevalence compared with the sedentary group (0 hours/week) (p trend=0.003). In contrast, high durations of work physical activity (≥10 hours/week) were associated with an approximate twofold higher prevalence of depression compared with being sedentary (0 hours/week) (p trend=0.005). No significant associations were observed for steps/day in men or for other types of self-reported activity including total physical activity in both men and women. Conclusions These findings indicate that the context in which physical activity is assessed and the measurement methods utilized are important considerations when investigating associations between physical activity and depression.},

  abstract = {An extensive literature on childhood adversity and neurodevelopment has emerged over the past decade. We evaluate two conceptual models of adversity and neurodevelopment—the dimensional model of adversity and stress acceleration model—in a systematic review of 109 studies using MRI-based measures of neural structure and function in children and adolescents. Consistent with the dimensional model, children exposed to threat had reduced amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and hippocampal volume and heightened amygdala activation to threat in a majority of studies; these patterns were not observed consistently in children exposed to deprivation. In contrast, reduced volume and altered function in frontoparietal regions were observed consistently in children exposed to deprivation but not children exposed to threat. Evidence for accelerated development in amygdala-mPFC circuits was limited but emerged in other metrics of neurodevelopment. Progress in charting neurodevelopmental consequences of adversity requires larger samples, longitudinal designs, and more precise assessments of adversity.},

  abstract = {Despite long-standing interest in the influence of adverse early experiences on mental health, systematic scientific inquiry into childhood adversity and developmental outcomes has emerged only recently. Existing research has amply demonstrated that exposure to childhood adversity is associated with elevated risk for multiple forms of youth psychopathology. In contrast, knowledge of developmental mechanisms linking childhood adversity to the onset of psychopathology—and whether those mechanisms are general or specific to particular kinds of adversity—remains cursory. Greater understanding of these pathways and identification of protective factors that buffer children from developmental disruptions following exposure to adversity is essential to guide the development of interventions to prevent the onset of psychopathology following adverse childhood experiences. This article provides recommendations for future research in this area. In particular, use of a consistent definition of childhood adversity, integration of studies of typical development with those focused on childhood adversity, and identification of distinct dimensions of environmental experience that differentially influence development are required to uncover mechanisms that explain how childhood adversity is associated with numerous psychopathology outcomes (i.e., multifinality) and identify moderators that shape divergent trajectories following adverse childhood experiences. A transdiagnostic model that highlights disruptions in emotional processing and poor executive functioning as key mechanisms linking childhood adversity with multiple forms of psychopathology is presented as a starting point in this endeavour. Distinguishing between general and specific mechanisms linking childhood adversity with psychopathology is needed to generate empirically informed interventions to prevent the long-term consequences of adverse early environments on children’s development.},

Intensive longitudinal designs often investigate constructs related to affect or mood and do so with multiple item scales. However, applications of intensive longitudinal methods often rely on simple sums or averages of the administered items rather than considering a proper measurement model. This paper demonstrates how to incorporate measurement models into DSEM to (1) provide more rigorous measurement of constructs used in intensive longitudinal studies and (2) assess whether scales are invariant across time and across people, which is not possible when item responses are summed or averaged. We provide an example from an ecological momentary assessment study on self-regulation in adults with binge eating disorder and walkthrough how to fit the model in Mplus and how to interpret the results.},

  abstract = {A common way to form scores from multiple-item scales is to sum responses of all items. Though sum scoring is often contrasted with factor analysis as a competing method, we review how factor analysis and sum scoring both fall under the larger umbrella of latent variable models, with sum scoring being a constrained version of a factor analysis. Despite similarities, reporting of psychometric properties for sum scored or factor analyzed scales are quite different. Further, if researchers use factor analysis to validate a scale but subsequently sum score the scale, this employs a model that differs from validation model. By framing sum scoring within a latent variable framework, our goal is to raise awareness that (a) sum scoring requires rather strict constraints, (b) imposing these constraints requires the same type of justification as any other latent variable model, and (c) sum scoring corresponds to a statistical model and is not a model-free arithmetic calculation. We discuss how unjustified sum scoring can have adverse effects on validity, reliability, and qualitative classification from sum score cut-offs. We also discuss considerations for how to use scale scores in subsequent analyses and how these choices can alter conclusions. The general goal is to encourage researchers to more critically evaluate how they obtain, justify, and use multiple-item scale scores.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen the rapid proliferation of clinical prediction models aiming to support risk stratification and individualized care within psychiatry. Despite growing interest, attempts to synthesize current evidence in the nascent field of precision psychiatry have remained scarce. This systematic review therefore sought to summarize progress towards clinical implementation of prediction modeling for psychiatric outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and PsychINFO databases from inception to September 30, 2020, for English-language articles that developed and/or validated multivariable models to predict (at an individual level) onset, course, or treatment response for non-organic psychiatric disorders (PROSPERO: CRD42020216530). Individual prediction models were evaluated based on three key criteria: (i) mitigation of bias and overfitting; (ii) generalizability, and (iii) clinical utility. The Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) was used to formally appraise each study’s risk of bias. 228 studies detailing 308 prediction models were ultimately eligible for inclusion. 94.5\% of developed prediction models were deemed to be at high risk of bias, largely due to inadequate or inappropriate analytic decisions. Insufficient internal validation efforts (within the development sample) were also observed, while only one-fifth of models underwent external validation in an independent sample. Finally, our search identified just one published model whose potential utility in clinical practice was formally assessed. Our findings illustrated significant growth in precision psychiatry with promising progress towards real-world application. Nevertheless, these efforts have been inhibited by a preponderance of bias and overfitting, while the generalizability and clinical utility of many published models has yet to be formally established. Through improved methodological rigor during initial development, robust evaluations of reproducibility via independent validation, and evidence-based implementation frameworks, future research has the potential to generate risk prediction tools capable of enhancing clinical decision-making in psychiatric care.},

There was a statistically significantly negative association between the mood item on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and smartphone-based self-monitored mood (B\,=\,−\,0.76, 95\% CI −\,0.91; −\,0.63, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and between psychomotor item on HAMD and self-monitored activity (B\,=\,−\,0.44, 95\% CI −\,0.63; −\,0.25, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Smartphone-based self-monitored mood differed between young patients with newly diagnosed BD and HC (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and between UR and HC (p\,=\,0.008) and was positively associated with smartphone-based self-reported activity (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and sleep duration (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). The findings support the potential of smartphone-based self-monitoring of mood and activity as part of a biomarker for young patients with BD and UR. Smartphone-based self-monitored mood is better to discriminate between young patients with newly diagnosed BD and HC, and between UR and HC, compared with smartphone-based activity and sleep.},

Here, we investigated whether increased engagement with digital social tools may help mitigate effects of enforced isolation on physical activity and mood, in a naturalistic study of at-risk individuals. Passively sensed smartphone app use and actigraphy data were collected from a group of psychiatric outpatients before and during imposition of strict Covid-19 lockdown measures. Data were analysed using Gaussian graphical models: a form of network analysis which gives insight into the predictive relationships between measures across timepoints. Within-individuals, we found evidence of a positive predictive path between digital social engagement, general smartphone use, and physical activity—selectively under lockdown conditions (N = 127 individual users, M = 6201 daily observations). Further, we observed a positive relationship between social media use and total daily steps across individuals during (but not prior to) lockdown. Although there are important limitations on the validity of drawing causal conclusions from observational data, a plausible explanation for our findings is that, during lockdown, individuals use their smartphones to access social support, which may help guard against negative effects of in-person social deprivation and other pandemic-related stress. Importantly, passive monitoring of smartphone app usage is low burden and non-intrusive. Given appropriate consent, this could help identify people who are failing to engage in usual patterns of digital social interaction, providing a route to early intervention.},

Understanding the temporal relationship between sleep and psychopathology is important for identifying and developing interventions which target key variables that contribute to relapse. Methods: We used a purpose-built digital platform to sample self-reported sleep and psychopathology variables over one year, in thirty-six individuals with schizophrenia. Once-daily measures of sleep duration and sleep quality, and fluctuations in psychopathology (positive and negative affect, cognition, and psychotic symptoms) were captured. We examined the temporal relationship between these variables using the Differential Time-Varying Effect (DTVEM) hybrid exploratory-confirmatory model. Results: Poorer sleep quality and shorter sleep duration maximally predicted deterioration in psychosis symptoms over the subsequent 1 – 8 and 1-12 days, respectively. These relationships were also mediated by negative affect and cognitive symptoms. Psychopathology variables also predicted sleep quality, but not sleep duration, and the effect sizes were smaller and of shorter lag duration. Conclusions: Reduced sleep duration and poorer sleep quality anticipate exacerbation of psychotic symptoms by approximately 1-2 weeks, and negative affect and cognitive symptoms mediate this relationship. We also observed a reciprocal relationship, that was of shorter duration and smaller magnitude. Sleep disturbance may play a causal role in symptom exacerbation and relapse, and represents an important and tractable target for intervention. It warrants greater attention as an early warning sign of deterioration, and low-burden, user-friendly digital tools may play a role in its early detection.},

Unfortunately, across scientific disciplines, many figures incorrectly present information or, when not incorrect, still use suboptimal data visualization practices. Presented here are ten principles that serve as guidance for authors who seek to improve their visual message. Some principles are less technical, such as determining the message before starting the visual, while other principles are more technical, such as how different color combinations imply different information. Because figure making is often not formally taught and figure standards are not readily enforced in science, it is incumbent upon scientists to be aware of best practices in order to most effectively tell the story of their data., Visuals are an increasingly important form of science communication, yet many scientists are not well trained in design principles for effective messaging. Despite challenges, many visuals can be improved by taking some simple steps before, during, and after their creation. This article presents some sequential principles that are designed to improve visual messages created by scientists., Many scientific visuals are not as effective as they could be because scientists often lack basic design principles. This article reviews the importance of effective data visualization and presents ten principles that scientists can use as guidance in developing effective visual messages.},

In the present article, we briefly describe John Bowlby's model of therapeutic change, the therapeutic relationship, and the therapist's role in emotional healing. We then review empirical evidence for three key propositions in Bowlby's model. First, a client's sense of security during therapy is crucial for facilitating therapeutic work. Second, a therapist's own sense of security contributes to positive therapeutic outcomes. Third, attachment insecurities can be effectively reduced in therapy, and movement toward greater attachment security is central to achieving favorable therapeutic outcomes. In sum, research evidence confirms the importance of establishing what Bowlby called a safe haven and a secure base within a therapeutic relationship.},

The field of alliance rupture research has largely focused on therapists’ role in repairing ruptures or patient characteristics associated with greater rupture frequency, with little research on how the patient contributes to rupture repair. This study examines the predictive relationship between patients’ attachment and the report of the rupture resolution process over the course of treatment. Patients’ attachment was measured with the Patient Attachment Coding System (PACS), which assesses patients’ attachment as different ways of communicating about present internal experience during the session. Alliance ruptures were measured via self-report items on a postsession questionnaire. Results show that secure in-session attachment is associated with higher ratings of rupture repair, according to both patients and therapists, and that the link between secure in-session attachment and repair increased when ruptures were more intense.

  abstract = {Among people exposed to major psychological stressors in early life, there are elevated rates of morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases of aging. The most compelling data come from studies of children raised in poverty or maltreated by their parents, who show heightened vulnerability to vascular disease, autoimmune disorders, and premature mortality. These findings raise challenging theoretical questions. How does childhood stress get under the skin, at the molecular level, to affect risk for later diseases? And how does it incubate there, giving rise to diseases several decades later? Here we present a Biological Embedding Model, which attempts to address these questions by synthesizing knowledge across several behavioral and biomedical literatures. This model maintains that childhood stress gets “programmed” into macrophages through epigenetic markings, post-translational modifications, and tissue remodeling. As a consequence these cells are endowed with pro-inflammatory tendencies, manifest in exaggerated cytokine responses to challenge and decreased sensitivity to inhibitory hormonal signals. The model goes on to propose that over the lifecourse, these pro-inflammatory tendencies are exacerbated by behavioral proclivities and hormonal dysregulation, themselves the products of exposure to early stress. Behaviorally, the model posits that childhood stress gives rise to excessive threat vigilance, mistrust of others, poor social relationships, impaired self-regulation, and unhealthy lifestyle choices. Hormonally, early stress confers altered patterns of endocrine and autonomic discharge. This milieu amplifies the pro-inflammatory environment already instantiated by macrophages. Acting in concert with other exposures and genetic liabilities, the resulting inflammation drives forward pathogenic mechanisms that ultimately foster chronic disease.},

However, little is known which behavioral factors are relevant, and how patterns of activity change during depressive episodes. We expected that compared to controls, in depressed individuals the level of activity would be lower, the amplitude of 24-h-actigraphy profiles more dampened and daytime activities would start later. We used 14-day continuous-actigraphy data from participants in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) who participated in an ambulatory assessment study. Participants with a depression diagnosis in the past 6 months (n\,=\,58) or its subsample with acute depression (DSM diagnosis in the past 1 month, n\,=\,43) were compared to controls without diagnoses (n\,=\,63). Depression was diagnosed with a diagnostic interview. Actigraphy-derived variables were activity mean levels (MESOR), the difference between peak and mean level (amplitude) and the timing of the activity peak (acrophase), which were estimated with cosinor analysis. Compared to the control group, both depression groups (total: B\,=\,−0.003, p\,=\,0.033; acute: B\,=\,−0.004, p\,=\,0.005) had lower levels of physical activity. Amplitude was also dampened, but in the acute depression group only (total: B\,=\,−0.002, p\,=\,0.065; acute: B\,=\,−0.003, p\,=\,0.011). Similarly, the timing of activity was marginally significant towards a later timing of activity in the acute, but not total depression group (total: B\,=\,0.206, p\,=\,0.398; acute: B\,=\,0.405, p\,=\,0.084). In conclusion, our findings may be relevant for understanding how different aspects of activity (level and timing) contribute to depression. Further prospective research is needed to disentangle the direction of the association between depression and daily rest-activity rhythms.},

  abstract = {Background:  In many countries, depressed individuals often first visit primary care settings for consultation, but a considerable number of clinically depressed patients remain unidentified. Introducing additional screening tools may facilitate the diagnostic process.  Objective:  This study aimed to examine whether experience sampling method (ESM)-based measures of depressive affect and behaviors can discriminate depressed from nondepressed individuals. In addition, the added value of actigraphy-based measures was examined.  Methods:  We used data from 2 samples to develop and validate prediction models. The development data set included 14 days of ESM and continuous actigraphy of currently depressed (n=43) and nondepressed individuals (n=82). The validation data set included 30 days of ESM and continuous actigraphy of currently depressed (n=27) and nondepressed individuals (n=27). Backward stepwise logistic regression analysis was applied to build the prediction models. Performance of the models was assessed with goodness-of-fit indices, calibration curves, and discriminative ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]).  Results:  In the development data set, the discriminative ability was good for the actigraphy model (AUC=0.790) and excellent for both the ESM (AUC=0.991) and the combined-domains model (AUC=0.993). In the validation data set, the discriminative ability was reasonable for the actigraphy model (AUC=0.648) and excellent for both the ESM (AUC=0.891) and the combined-domains model (AUC=0.892).  Conclusions:  ESM is a good diagnostic predictor and is easy to calculate, and it therefore holds promise for implementation in clinical practice. Actigraphy shows no added value to ESM as a diagnostic predictor but might still be useful when ESM use is restricted.  [J Med Internet Res 2020;22(12):e22634]},

Aims               To determine via meta-analysis the diagnostic accuracy of the PHQ-9-linear, PHQ-9-algorithm and PHQ-2 questions to detect major depressive disorder (MDD) among adults.                                         Method               We systematically searched major electronic databases from inception until June 2015. Articles were included that reported the accuracy of PHQ-9 or PHQ-2 questions for diagnosing MDD in primary care defined according to standard classification systems. We carried out a meta-analysis, meta-regression, moderator and sensitivity analysis.                                         Results               Overall, 26 publications reporting on 40 individual studies were included representing 26 902 people (median 502, s.d.=693.7) including 14 760 unique adults of whom 14.3\% had MDD. The methodological quality of the included articles was acceptable. The meta-analytic area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the PHQ-9-linear and the PHQ-2 was significantly higher than the PHQ-9-algorithm, a difference that was maintained in head-to-head meta-analysis of studies. Our best estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 81.3\% (95\% CI 71.6–89.3) and 85.3\% (95\% CI 81.0–89.1), 56.8\% (95\% CI 41.2–71.8) and 93.3\% (95\% CI 87.5–97.3) and 89.3\% (95\% CI 81.5–95.1) and 75.9\% (95\% CI 70.1–81.3) for the PHQ-9-linear, PHQ-9-algorithm and PHQ-2 respectively. For case finding (ruling in a diagnosis), none of the methods were suitable but for screening (ruling out non-cases), all methods were encouraging with good clinical utility, although the cut-off threshold must be carefully chosen.                                         Conclusions               The PHQ can be used as an initial first step assessment in primary care and the PHQ-2 is adequate for this purpose with good acceptability. However, neither the PHQ-2 nor the PHQ-9 can be used to confirm a clinical diagnosis (case finding).},

  abstract = {Intensive longitudinal studies typically examine phenomena that vary across time, individuals, contexts, and other boundary conditions. This poses challenges to the conceptualization and identification of replicability and generalizability, which refer to the invariance of research findings across samples and contexts as crucial criteria for trustworthiness. Some of these challenges are specific to intensive longitudinal studies, others are similarly relevant for the work with other complex datasets that contain multilayered sources of variation (individuals nested in different types of activities or organizations, regions, countries, etc.) This article opens with discussing the reasons why research findings may fail to replicate. We then analyze reasons why research findings may falsely appear to be non-replicable when in fact they were as such replicable, but lacked generalizability due to heterogeneity between samples, subgroups, individuals, time points, and contexts. Following that, we propose conceptual and methodological approaches to better disentangle non-replicability from non-generalizability and to better understand the exact causes of either problem. In particular, we apply Lakatos’s proposition to examine not only whether but under what boundary conditions a theory is a useful description of the world, to the question whether and under which conditions a research finding is replicable and generalizable. Not only will that contribute to a more systematic understanding of and research on replicability and generalizability in longitudinal studies and beyond, but it will also be a contribution to what has been called the heterogeneity revolution (Bryan et al., 2021; Moeller, 2021).},

  abstract = {A major problem in mental health clinical trials, such as depression, is low assay sensitivity in primary outcome measures. This has contributed to clinical trial failures, resulting in the exodus of the pharmaceutical industry from the Central Nervous System space. This reduced assay sensitivity in psychiatry outcome measures stems from inappropriately broad measures, recall bias, and poor interrater reliability. Limitations in the ability of traditional measures to differentiate between the trait versus state-like nature of individual depressive symptoms also contributes to measurement error in clinical trials. In this viewpoint, we argue that ecological momentary assessment (EMA)—frequent, real time, in-the-moment assessments of outcomes, delivered via smartphone—can both overcome these psychometric challenges and reduce clinical trial failures by increasing assay sensitivity and minimizing recall and rater bias. Used in this manner, EMA has the potential to further our understanding of treatment response by allowing for the assessment of dynamic interactions between treatment and distinct symptom response.},

Results thus obtained are considered to be generalizable to the understanding and explanation of variation within single cases (intraindividual variation). It is indicated, however, that the direct consequences of the classical ergodic theorems for psychology and psychometrics invalidate this conjectured generalizability: only under very strict conditions-which are hardly obtained in real psychological processes-can a generalization be made from a structure of interindividual variation to the analogous structure of intraindividual variation. Illustrations of the lack of this generalizability are given in the contexts of psychometrics, developmental psychology, and personality theory.},

  abstract = {Psychological theories are statements of constraint. The role of hypothesis testing in psychology is to test whether specific theoretical constraints hold in data. Bayesian statistics is well suited to the task of finding supporting evidence for constraint, because it allows for comparing evidence for 2 hypotheses against each another. One issue in hypothesis testing is that constraints may hold only approximately rather than exactly, and the reason for small deviations may be trivial or uninteresting. In the large-sample limit, these uninteresting, small deviations lead to the rejection of a useful constraint. In this article, we develop several Bayes factor 1-sample tests for the assessment of approximate equality and ordinal constraints. In these tests, the null hypothesis covers a small interval of non-0 but negligible effect sizes around 0. These Bayes factors are alternatives to previously developed Bayes factors, which do not allow for interval null hypotheses, and may especially prove useful to researchers who use statistical equivalence testing. To facilitate adoption of these Bayes factor tests, we provide easy-to-use software.},

We developed and tested a similar tool for eating disorders— with questions designed to raise suspicion that an eating disorder might exist—before rigorous clinical assessment.

This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (“ADEMP”); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume 34 of Statistics in Medicine, which included at least one simulation study and identify areas for improvement.},

  abstract = {Concerns about the veracity of psychological research have been growing. Many findings in psychological science are based on studies with insufficient statistical power and nonrepresentative samples, or may otherwise be limited to specific, ungeneralizable settings or populations. Crowdsourced research, a type of large-scale collaboration in which one or more research projects are conducted across multiple lab sites, offers a pragmatic solution to these and other current methodological challenges. The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is a distributed network of laboratories designed to enable and support crowdsourced research projects. These projects can focus on novel research questions or replicate prior research in large, diverse samples. The PSA’s mission is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science. Here, we describe the background, structure, principles, procedures, benefits, and challenges of the PSA. In contrast to other crowdsourced research networks, the PSA is ongoing (as opposed to time limited), efficient (in that structures and principles are reused for different projects), decentralized, diverse (in both subjects and researchers), and inclusive (of proposals, contributions, and other relevant input from anyone inside or outside the network). The PSA and other approaches to crowdsourced psychological science will advance understanding of mental processes and behaviors by enabling rigorous research and systematic examination of its generalizability.},

  abstract = {There have been considerable methodological developments of Bayes factors for hypothesis testing in the social and behavioral sciences, and related fields. This development is due to the flexibility of the Bayes factor for testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, the ability to test complex hypotheses involving equality as well as order constraints on the parameters of interest, and the interpretability of the outcome as the weight of evidence provided by the data in support of competing scientific theories. The available software tools for Bayesian hypothesis testing are still limited however. In this paper we present a new R package called BFpack that contains functions for Bayes factor hypothesis testing for the many common testing problems. The software includes novel tools for (i) Bayesian exploratory testing (e.g., zero vs positive vs negative effects), (ii) Bayesian confirmatory testing (competing hypotheses with equality and/or order constraints), (iii) common statistical analyses, such as linear regression, generalized linear models, (multivariate) analysis of (co)variance, correlation analysis, and random intercept models, (iv) using default priors, and (v) while allowing data to contain missing observations that are missing at random.},

A special case of the univariate F distribution for a variance parameter is equivalent to a half-t distribution for a standard deviation, which is becoming increasingly popular in the Bayesian literature. The matrix-F distribution can be conveniently modeled as a Wishart mixture of Wishart or inverse Wishart distributions, which allows straightforward implementation in a Gibbs sampler. By mixing the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution with a matrix-F distribution, a multivariate horseshoe type prior is obtained which is useful for modeling sparse signals. Furthermore, it is shown that the intrinsic prior for testing covariance matrices in non-hierarchical models has a matrix-F distribution. This intrinsic prior is also useful for testing inequality constrained hypotheses on variances. Finally through simulation it is shown that the matrix-variate F distribution has good frequentist properties as prior for the random effects covariance matrix in generalized linear mixed models.},

There are many plausible ways of specifying a regression model, but researchers typically report only a few preferred estimates. This raises the concern that such research reveals only a small fraction of the possible results and may easily lead to nonrobust, false positive conclusions. It is often unclear how much the results are driven by model specification and how much the results would change if a different plausible model were used. Computational model robustness analysis addresses this challenge by estimating all possible models from a theoretically informed model space. We use large-scale random noise simulations to show (1) the problem of excess false positive errors under model uncertainty and (2) that computational robustness analysis can identify and eliminate false positives caused by model uncertainty. We also draw on a series of empirical applications to further illustrate issues of model uncertainty and estimate instability. Computational robustness analysis offers a method for relaxing modeling assumptions and improving the transparency of applied research.},

The proposed method bases its logic on conditional equivalence of the summary-statistics approach and mixed-effects modeling, paring back the power analysis for mixed-effects modeling to that for a simpler statistical analysis (e.g., one-sample t test). Accordingly, the proposed method allows us to conduct power analysis for mixed-effects modeling using popular software such as GPower or the pwr package in R and, with minimum input from relevant prior work (e.g., t value). We provide analytic proof and a series of statistical simulations to show the validity and robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis and show illustrative examples with real published work. We also developed a web app (https://koumurayama.shinyapps.io/summary\_statistics\_based\_power/) to facilitate the utility of the proposed method. While the proposed method has limited flexibilities compared with the existing methods in terms of the models and designs that can be appropriately handled, it provides a convenient alternative for applied researchers when there is limited information to conduct power analysis.

Highlights of the historical review include 1) various examples of the use of qualitative and quantitative probabilities or odds in forecasts during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, 2) a brief discussion in 1890 of the economic component of the rationale for quantifying the uncertainty in forecasts, 3) further refinement of the rationale for probability forecasts and the presentation of the results of experiments involving the formulation of quasi-probabilistic and probabilistic forecasts during the period 1900–25 (in reviewing developments during this early twentieth century period, the noteworthy contributions made by W. E. Cooke, C. Hallenbeck, and A. K. Ångström are described and clarified), and 4) a very concise overview of activities and developments in this area since 1925. The early treatment of some basic issues related to probability forecasts is discussed and, in some cases, compared to their treatment in more recent times. These issues include 1) the underlying rationale for probability forecasts, 2) the feasibility of making probability forecasts, and 3) alternative interpretations of probability in the context of weather forecasts. A brief examination of factors related to the acceptance of—and resistance to—probability forecasts in the meteorological and user communities is also included.},

Separate lines of past research suggest that alterations in inflammatory processes and neural responses to threat may link lower social status with poorer outcomes. This study was designed to bridge these literatures to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms linking subjective social status and inflammation. Thirty-one participants reported their subjective social status, and underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while they were socially evaluated. Participants also provided blood samples before and after the stressor, which were analysed for changes in inflammation. Results showed that lower subjective social status was associated with greater increases in inflammation. Neuroimaging data revealed lower subjective social status was associated with greater neural activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) in response to negative feedback. Finally, results indicated that activation in the DMPFC in response to negative feedback mediated the relation between social status and increases in inflammatory activity. This study provides the first evidence of a neurocognitive pathway linking subjective social status and inflammation, thus furthering our understanding of how social hierarchies shape neural and physiological responses to social interactions.},

  abstract = {Background Evidence suggests that long-term trajectories of depressive symptoms vary greatly throughout the population, with some individuals experiencing few or no symptoms, some experiencing transient symptoms and others experiencing chronic depression. The goal of this paper was to review studies that examined heterogeneity in long-term trajectories of depressive symptoms and summarize the current knowledge regarding a) the number and patterns of trajectories and b) antecedents and outcomes associated with different trajectory patterns. Methods We conducted a systematic review of literature in the Medline and PsychINFO databases. Articles were included if they a) modeled trajectories of depressive symptoms, b) used a group-based trajectory modeling approach, c) followed participants for 5+ years and d) had a sample size of at least 200. Results We identified 25 studies from 24 separate cohorts. Most of the studies identified either 3 or 4 distinct trajectory classes. Trajectories varied in terms of severity (low, medium, high) and stability (stable, increasing, decreasing). In most studies, the majority of participants had consistently few or no depressive symptoms, but a notable minority (usually {$<$} 10\%) reported persistent symptoms. Predictors of trajectories with greater symptom burden included female gender, lower income/education and non-white race. Other predictors were specific to different populations (i.e. mothers, older adults). High symptom burden trajectories were associated with poor psychiatric and psychosocial outcomes. Limitations Comparisons between studies were qualitative. Conclusions Trajectories of depression symptoms in the general population are heterogeneous, with most individuals showing minimal symptoms but a notable minority experiencing chronic high symptom burden.},

  abstract = {In the mental health field, there is a growing awareness that the study of psychiatric symptoms in the context of everyday life, using experience sampling methodology (ESM), may provide a powerful and necessary addition to more conventional research approaches. ESM, a structured self-report diary technique, allows the investigation of experiences within, and in interaction with, the real-world context. This paper provides an overview of how zooming in on the micro-level of experience and behaviour using ESM adds new insights and additional perspectives to standard approaches. More specifically, it discusses how ESM: a) contributes to a deeper understanding of psychopathological phenomena, b) allows to capture variability over time, c) aids in identifying internal and situational determinants of variability in symptomatology, and d) enables a thorough investigation of the interaction between the person and his/her environment and of real-life social interactions. Next to improving assessment of psychopathology and its underlying mechanisms, ESM contributes to advancing and changing clinical practice by allowing a more fine-grained evaluation of treatment effects as well as by providing the opportunity for extending treatment beyond the clinical setting into real life with the development of ecological momentary interventions. Furthermore, this paper provides an overview of the technical details of setting up an ESM study in terms of design, questionnaire development and statistical approaches. Overall, although a number of considerations and challenges remain, ESM offers one of the best opportunities for personalized medicine in psychiatry, from both a research and a clinical perspective.},

Most researchers employ retrospective survey measurement, thus depending on the accuracy of users’ memories and generalizations. Alternatively, some researchers rely on in-situ measurement, being less dependent on users’ memories and generalizations, but requiring random situation samples. To assess differences and similarities between these two measurement approaches we analyzed whether characteristics (duration and frequency of a usage episode, habit, elaboration, and gratifications) of MSM use (regarding Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube) vary between retrospective survey and mobile experience sampling measurement. We observe a consistent pattern of higher estimates in retrospect as compared to individual averages of in-situ reports. The absolute magnitude of these differences varies considerably between platforms and characteristics studied. Nonetheless, for most constructs and platforms we find low significant positive correlations between retrospective and aggregated in-situ values.},

The non-inflammatory state does not arise passively from an absence of inflammatory stimuli; rather, maintenance of health requires the positive actions of specific gene products to suppress reactions to potentially inflammatory stimuli that do not warrant a full response.},

  abstract = {Background:  Individuals in stressful work environments often experience mental health issues, such as depression. Reducing depression rates is difficult because of persistently stressful work environments and inadequate time or resources to access traditional mental health care services. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions provide an opportunity to deliver real-time interventions in the real world. In addition, the delivery times of interventions can be based on real-time data collected with a mobile device. To date, data and analyses informing the timing of delivery of mHealth interventions are generally lacking.  Objective:  This study aimed to investigate when to provide mHealth interventions to individuals in stressful work environments to improve their behavior and mental health. The mHealth interventions targeted 3 categories of behavior: mood, activity, and sleep. The interventions aimed to improve 3 different outcomes: weekly mood (assessed through a daily survey), weekly step count, and weekly sleep time. We explored when these interventions were most effective, based on previous mood, step, and sleep scores.  Methods:  We conducted a 6-month micro-randomized trial on 1565 medical interns. Medical internship, during the first year of physician residency training, is highly stressful, resulting in depression rates several folds higher than those of the general population. Every week, interns were randomly assigned to receive push notifications related to a particular category (mood, activity, sleep, or no notifications). Every day, we collected interns’ daily mood valence, sleep, and step data. We assessed the causal effect moderation by the previous week’s mood, steps, and sleep. Specifically, we examined changes in the effect of notifications containing mood, activity, and sleep messages based on the previous week’s mood, step, and sleep scores. Moderation was assessed with a weighted and centered least-squares estimator.  Results:  We found that the previous week’s mood negatively moderated the effect of notifications on the current week’s mood with an estimated moderation of −0.052 ( P =.001). That is, notifications had a better impact on mood when the studied interns had a low mood in the previous week. Similarly, we found that the previous week’s step count negatively moderated the effect of activity notifications on the current week’s step count, with an estimated moderation of −0.039 ( P =.01) and that the previous week’s sleep negatively moderated the effect of sleep notifications on the current week’s sleep with an estimated moderation of −0.075 ( P \&lt;.001). For all three of these moderators, we estimated that the treatment effect was positive (beneficial) when the moderator was low, and negative (harmful) when the moderator was high.  Conclusions:  These findings suggest that an individual’s current state meaningfully influences their receptivity to mHealth interventions for mental health. Timing interventions to match an individual’s state may be critical to maximizing the efficacy of interventions.

The relations between observed and unobserved variables are key to an empirical approach to building explanatory theories and we are especially concerned about how the former are used as proxies for the latter. We believe that behavioral science can profitably reconsider the prevailing version of this arrangement because of its vulnerability to limiting idiosyncratic aspects of observed/unobserved variable relations. We describe a general measurement approach that takes into account idiosyncrasies that should be irrelevant to the measurement process but can intrude and may invalidate it in ways that distort and weaken relations among theoretically important variables. To clarify further our major concerns, we briefly describe one version of the measurement approach that fundamentally supports the individual as the primary unit of analysis orientation that we believe should be preeminent in the scientific study of human behavior.},

When the research focus is on developmental phenomena such as aging, the complexity of the task is even greater because of the difficulties of modeling and accounting for systematic changes in behavior. Proper decisions about which research methods to use rest on four principal concerns: (1) general orientation of the research; (2) theoretical assumptions concerning the nature of the phenomenon being studied; (3) data collection strategy; and (4) data analysis tactics.Replicated, multivariate, single-subject research designs such as P-technique involve assessment with multiple variables at each of many times of measurement. The resulting data, which are analyzed to determine the nature of occasion-to-occasion changes in the variables, can inform about both covariation patterns and level. Such designs have not been exploited by researchers in aging even though concern with a variety of intraindividual changes in older adulthood is evident in the literature. The rationale of such designs and their potential utility for the study of adult development and aging are examined and discussed.},

  abstract = {The growing availability of intensive longitudinal data has increased psychological researchers' interest in ideographic-statistical methods that, for example, reveal the contemporaneous or lagged associations between different variables for a specific individual. However, when researchers assess several individuals, the results of such models are difficult to generalize across individuals. Researchers recently suggested an algorithm called GIMME, which allows for the identification of coefficients that exist across all individuals (group-level coefficients) or are specific to one or a subgroup of individuals (individual-level coefficients). In three simulation studies we investigated GIMME's performance in recovering group-level and individual-level coefficients. For the former, we found that GIMME performed well when the magnitude of the parameters was moderate to high and when the number of measurements was sufficiently large. However, GIMME had problems detecting individual-level coefficients or coefficients that occurred for a subset of individuals from the whole sample.},

  abstract = {Research in psychology is experiencing a rapid increase in the availability of intensive longitudinal data. To use such data for predicting feelings, beliefs, and behavior, recent methodological work suggested combinations of the longitudinal mixed-effect model with Lasso regression or with regression trees. The present article adds to this literature by suggesting an extension of these models that—in addition to a random effect for the mean level—also includes a random effect for the within-subject variance and a random effect for the autocorrelation. After introducing the extended mixed-effect location scale (E-MELS), the extended mixed-effect location-scale Lasso model (Lasso E-MELS), and the extended mixed-effect location-scale tree model (E-MELS trees), we show how its parameters can be estimated using a marginal maximum likelihood approach. Using real and simulated example data, we illustrate how to use E-MELS, Lasso E-MELS, and E-MELS trees for building prediction models to forecast individuals’ daily nervousness. The article is accompanied by an R package (called mels) and functions that support users in the application of the suggested models.},

  abstract = {Within-person couplings play a prominent role in psychological research and previous studies have shown that interindividual differences in within-person couplings predict future behavior. For example, stress reactivity—operationalized as the within-person coupling of stress and positive or negative affect—is an important predictor of various (mental) health outcomes and has often been assumed to be a more or less stable personality trait. However, issues of reliability of these couplings have been largely neglected so far. In this work, we present an estimate for the reliability of within-person couplings that can be easily obtained using the user-modifiable R code accompanying this work. Results of a simulation study show that this index performs well even in the context of unbalanced data due to missing values. We demonstrate the application of this index in a measurement burst study targeting the reliability and test–retest correlation of stress reactivity estimates operationalized as within-person couplings in a daily diary design. Reliability and test–retest correlations of stress reactivity estimates were rather low, challenging the implicit assumption of stress reactivity as a stable person-level variable. We highlight key factors that researchers planning studies targeting interindividual differences in within-person couplings should consider to maximize reliability.},

In 1954 two foundational standards were announced: (a) Thou shalt not refer to "the validity of the test" and (b) thou shalt use validity modifier labels, such as "content validity" or "predictive validity." Subsequently, in 1985, the latter became, thou shalt not use validity modifier labels. These standards for talking about validity have repeatedly been disregarded over the years. Possible reasons include intentional misuse, while upholding standards for thinking about validity; lack of awareness or misunderstanding of standards for thinking about validity; and genuine divergence from standards for thinking about validity. A historical analysis of disregard for these standards provides a basis for reappraising the concept of validity. We amassed a new body of evidence with which to challenge the frequently asserted claim that a general consensus exists over the meaning of validity. Indeed, the historical analysis provides reason to believe that prospects for achieving consensus over the meaning of validity are low. We recommend that the concept of validity be abandoned in favor of the more general, all-encompassing concept of quality, to be judged in relation to measurement aims, decision making aims, and broader policy aims, respectively.},

Design Time series analysis. Setting United States, 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2018. Participants Total US population. Lifeline calls and suicide data were obtained from Lifeline and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Main outcome measures Daily Lifeline calls and suicide data before and after the release of the song. Twitter posts were used to estimate the amount and duration of attention the song received. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average time series models were fitted to the pre-release period to estimate Lifeline calls and suicides. Models were fitted to the full time series with dummy variables for periods of strong attention to the song. Results In the 34 day period after the three events with the strongest public attention (the song’s release, the MTV Video Music Awards 2017, and Grammy Awards 2018), Lifeline received an excess of 9915 calls (95\% confidence interval 6594 to 13 236), an increase of 6.9\% (95\% confidence interval 4.6\% to 9.2\%, P{$<$}0.001) over the expected number. A corresponding model for suicides indicated a reduction over the same period of 245 suicides (95\% confidence interval 36 to 453) or 5.5\% (95\% confidence interval 0.8\% to 10.1\%, P=0.02) below the expected number of suicides. Conclusions Logic’s song “1-800-273-8255” was associated with a large increase in calls to Lifeline. A reduction in suicides was observed in the periods with the most social media discourse about the song.},

  abstract = {The constant development of new data analysis methods in many fields of research is accompanied by an increasing awareness that these new methods often perform better in their introductory paper than in subsequent comparison studies conducted by other researchers. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by conducting a systematic experiment that we call “cross-design validation of methods”. In the experiment, we select two methods designed for the same data analysis task, reproduce the results shown in each paper, and then reevaluate each method based on the study design (i.e., datasets, competing methods, and evaluation criteria) that was used to show the abilities of the other method. We conduct the experiment for two data analysis tasks, namely cancer subtyping using multiomic data and differential gene expression analysis. Three of the four methods included in the experiment indeed perform worse when they are evaluated on the new study design, which is mainly caused by the different datasets. Apart from illustrating the many degrees of freedom existing in the assessment of a method and their effect on its performance, our experiment suggests that the performance discrepancies between original and subsequent papers may not only be caused by the nonneutrality of the authors proposing the new method but also by differences regarding the level of expertise and field of application. Authors of new methods should thus focus not only on a transparent and extensive evaluation but also on comprehensive method documentation that enables the correct use of their methods in subsequent studies.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the need for neutral benchmark studies that focus on the comparison of methods coming from computational sciences has been increasingly recognized by the scientific community. While general advice on the design and analysis of neutral benchmark studies can be found in recent literature, a certain flexibility always exists. This includes the choice of data sets and performance measures, the handling of missing performance values, and the way the performance values are aggregated over the data sets. As a consequence of this flexibility, researchers may be concerned about how their choices affect the results or, in the worst case, may be tempted to engage in questionable research practices (e.g., the selective reporting of results or the post hoc modification of design or analysis components) to fit their expectations. To raise awareness for this issue, we use an example benchmark study to illustrate how variable benchmark results can be when all possible combinations of a range of design and analysis options are considered. We then demonstrate how the impact of each choice on the results can be assessed using multidimensional unfolding. In conclusion, based on previous literature and on our illustrative example, we claim that the multiplicity of design and analysis options combined with questionable research practices lead to biased interpretations of benchmark results and to over-optimistic conclusions. This issue should be considered by computational researchers when designing and analyzing their benchmark studies and by the scientific community in general in an effort towards more reliable benchmark results.

In this study, participants were randomly assigned to conditions where they completed two depression and two generalized anxiety rating scales that used either frequency or severity item response options. Descriptive statistics and reliability estimates across depression and generalized anxiety scales using different item response options were similar. Measurement invariance tests indicated that depression and generalized anxiety scales with different item response options could be considered practically invariant. Finally, depression and generalized anxiety scales with different item response options had similar correlations with measures of impairment and other psychological constructs. There were essentially no differences in psychometric and measurement properties of these depression and generalized anxiety scales when using different item response options, suggesting this may not substantially affect the measurement of these constructs.},

Schmid Noerr faßt zunächst Freuds Symboltheorie zusammen und beschreibt die doppelte Herkunft des Symbolbegriffs aus den frühen Hysterie-Arbeiten und der Traumdeutung. Anschließend stellt er Lorenzers Versuch dar, diese alte psychoanalytische Symbolauffassung als Teilaspekt einer umfassenderen Theorie der Symbolbildung zu integrieren: Lorenzer entwickelt seine Theorie der Interaktionsformen und der Symbolbildung, der zufolge bereits im embryonalen Stadium bestimmte Interaktionsformen sich herauszubilden beginnen, die sich später zu symbolischen Interaktionsformen weiterentwickeln. Wichtigste Symbolform ist bei Lorenzer die Sprache, neben die »sinnlich-symbolische Interaktionsformen« treten, was eine Unterscheidung von präsentativen und diskursiven Symbolen (Susanne Langer) ermöglicht. Schmid Noerr macht auf gewisse Inkonsistenzen und Unklarheiten in Lorenzers Definition diskursiver und präsentativer Symbolik aufmerksam, die mit partiellen Verhaftungen in der traditionellen psychoanalytischen Theorie der genetischen Vorgängigkeit des Primärprozesses gegenüber dem Sekundärprozeß zusammenhängen.

  abstract = {The response styles theory (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991) was proposed to explain the insidious relationship between rumination and depression. We review the aspects of the response styles theory that have been well-supported, including evidence that rumination exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, impairs problem solving, interferes with instrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Next, we address contradictory and new findings. Specifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms. Contrary to original predictions, the use of positive distractions has not consistently been correlated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in correlational studies, although dozens of experimental studies show positive distractions relieve depressed mood. Further, evidence now suggests that rumination is associated with psychopathologies in addition to depression, including anxiety, binge eating, binge drinking, and self-harm. We discuss the relationships between rumination and worry and between rumination and other coping or emotion-regulation strategies. Finally, we highlight recent research on the distinction between rumination and more adaptive forms of self-reflection, on basic cognitive deficits or biases in rumination, on its neural and genetic correlates, and on possible interventions to combat rumination.},

Patients with panic disorder or social anxiety disorder were randomized to either stepped care (n=85) or direct FtF CBT (n=88). Recovery was defined as meeting two of the following three criteria: loss of diagnosis, below cut-off for self-reported symptoms, and functional improvement. No significant differences in intention-to-treat recovery rates were identified between stepped care (40.0\%) and direct FtF CBT (43.2\%). The majority of the patients who recovered in the stepped care did so at the less therapist-demanding steps (26/34, 76.5\%). Moderate to large within-groups effect sizes were identified at posttreatment and 1-year follow-up. The attrition rates were high: 41.2\% in the stepped care condition and 27.3\% in the direct FtF CBT condition. These findings indicate that the outcome of a stepped care model for anxiety disorders is comparable to that of direct FtF CBT. The rates of improvement at the two less therapist-demanding steps indicate that stepped care models might be useful for increasing patients’ access to evidence-based psychological treatments for anxiety disorders. However, attrition in the stepped care condition was high, and research regarding the factors that can improve adherence should be prioritized.},

  abstract = {In addition to benefiting reproducibility and transparency, one of the advantages of using R is that researchers have a much larger range of fully customizable data visualizations options than are typically available in point-and-click software because of the open-source nature of R. These visualization options not only look attractive but also can increase transparency about the distribution of the underlying data rather than relying on commonly used visualizations of aggregations, such as bar charts of means. In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to data visualization using R specifically aimed at researchers who have little to no prior experience of using R. First, we detail the rationale for using R for data visualization and introduce the ?grammar of graphics? that underlies data visualization using the ggplot package. The tutorial then walks the reader through how to replicate plots that are commonly available in point-and-click software, such as histograms and box plots, and shows how the code for these ?basic? plots can be easily extended to less commonly available options, such as violin box plots. The data set and code used in this tutorial and an interactive version with activity solutions, additional resources, and advanced plotting options are available at https://osf.io/bj83f/.},

  abstract = {Children who experience chronic stressors are vulnerable to emotional and physical health problems across the lifespan. This phenomenon raises questions for scientists and clinicians alike. How does adversity get “under the skin” of the developing child? Through what mechanisms does it confer vulnerability to a heterogeneous set of mental and physical illnesses? And how does it instantiate risk across different life stages, engendering vulnerability to conditions that develop shortly after stressor exposure – like depression – and conditions which manifest decades later, like heart disease? Although answers to these questions have started to emerge, research has typically focused on single diseases or organ systems. To understand the plethora of health problems associated with childhood adversity, we argue that the field needs a second generation of research that recognizes multidirectional transactions amongst biological systems. To help facilitate this process, we propose a neuro-immune network hypothesis as a heuristic framework for organizing knowledge from disparate literatures, and as a springboard for generating integrative research. Drawing on existing data, we argue that early-life adversity amplifies crosstalk between peripheral inflammation and neural circuitries subserving threat-, reward-, and executive control-related processes. This crosstalk results in chronic low-grade inflammation, thereby contributing to adiposity, insulin resistance, and other predisease states. In the brain, inflammatory mediators act on cortico-amygdala threat, and cortico-basal ganglia reward, circuitries in a manner that predisposes individuals to self-medicating behaviors like smoking, drug use, and consumption of high-fat diets. Acting in concert with inflammation, these behaviors accelerate the pathogenesis of emotional and physical health problems.},

The symptoms cause huge distress, have a major impact on quality of life, and are a strong risk factor for suicide. As well as the subjective experience of sleep symptoms, there are well-documented changes in objective sleep architecture in depression. Mechanisms of sleep regulation and how they might be disturbed in depression are discussed. The sleep symptoms are often unresolved by treatment, and confer a greater risk of relapse and recurrence. Epidemiological studies have pointed out that insomnia in nondepressed subjects is a risk factor for later development of depression. There is therefore a need for more successful management of sleep disturbance in depression, in order to improve quality of life in these patients and reduce an important factor in depressive relapse and recurrence.},

  abstract = {Background                Late-life depression (LLD) is associated with a decline in physical activity. Typically this is assessed by self-report questionnaires and, more recently, with actigraphy. We sought to explore the utility of a bespoke activity monitor to characterize activity profiles in LLD more precisely.                                          Method                The activity monitor was worn for 7 days by 29 adults with LLD and 30 healthy controls. Subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment and quality of life (QoL) (36-item Short-Form Health Survey) and activities of daily living (ADL) scales (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale) were administered.                                          Results                Physical activity was significantly reduced in LLD compared with controls (t = 3.63, p {$<$} 0.001), primarily in the morning. LLD subjects showed slower fine motor movements (t = 3.49, p {$<$} 0.001). In LLD patients, activity reductions were related to reduced ADL (r = 0.61, p {$<$} 0.001), lower QoL (r = 0.65, p {$<$} 0.001), associative learning (r = 0.40, p = 0.036), and higher Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score (r = −0.37, p {$<$} 0.05).                                          Conclusions                Patients with LLD had a significant reduction in general physical activity compared with healthy controls.

Method Participants [n~=~372 at baseline and n~=~303 at follow-up] completed perceived stress, depressive symptoms and life events scales at baseline and 5–6 month follow-up. Life events were correlated with perceived stress and depressive symptoms scales using Pearson correlation. Multivariate linear regression tested the relationship between the 20 most common life events with perceived stress and depressive symptoms. Regression models explored relationships between life events, perceived stress and depressive symptoms and the intervention effect. Results Higher levels of perceived stress and depressive symptoms correlated with more life events. At baseline, for every additional life event, depressive symptoms were higher; follow-up showed marginal significance with depressive symptoms, but a strong positive association with perceived stress. In the stratified model, for every life event at follow up, the perceived stress scale increased by 0.68 in the exercise group, but not in the controls. For every life event at follow-up, depressive symptoms were higher in controls, but not in the exercise group. Conclusion Perceived stress and depressive symptoms co-occurred with life events at baseline and follow-up for participants. At follow up, perceived stress increased significantly among exercisers; depressive symptoms were significantly higher among controls. Findings suggest that new participation in structured physical activity entails a change in daily life that may buffer against depressive symptoms in relation to life events but not perceived stress.},

The objective of this study was to better understand therapeutic change, by illustrating how symptoms evolve and interact during psychotherapy. Data from 113,608 patients from psychological therapy services who completed depression and anxiety symptom measures across three to six therapy sessions were analysed. A panel graphical vector-autoregression model was estimated in a model development sample (N\,=\,68,165) and generalizability was tested in a confirmatory model, fitted to a separate (hold-out) sample of patients (N\,=\,45,443). The model displayed an excellent fit and replicated in the confirmatory holdout sample. First, we found that nearly all symptoms were statistically related to each other (i.e. dense connectivity), indicating that no one symptom or association drives change. Second, the structure of symptom interrelations which emerged did not change across sessions. These findings provide a dynamic view of the process of symptom change during psychotherapy and give rise to several causal hypotheses relating to structure, mechanism, and process.},

Symptoms of anxiety and depression also had significant independent effects on overall rumination and emotion‐driven rumination. However, worry partially accounted for the associations of both depression and anxiety with rumination. Those with mood and anxiety disorders also reported more rumination than controls, an effect that was amplified by increased comorbidity. Those with mood disorders reported significantly more rumination than those with anxiety disorders. The implications of these findings for a transdiagnostic view of rumination are discussed.

  abstract = {The article is a guided tour to Alfred LORENZER's proposal for an "in-depth hermeneutic" cultural analysis methodology which was launched in an environment with an almost complete split between social sciences and psychology/psychoanalysis. It presents the background in his materialist socialization theory, which combines a social reinterpretation of the core insights in classical psychoanalysis—the unconscious, the drives—with a theory of language acquisition. His methodology is based on a transformation of the "scenic understanding" from a clinical to a text interpretation, which seeks to understand collective unconscious meaning in text, and is presented with an illustration of the interpretation procedure from social research. Then follows a brief systematic account of key concepts and ideas—interaction forms, engrams, experience, symbolization, language game, utopian imagination—with an outlook to the social theory connections to the Frankfurt School. The practical interpretation procedure in a LORENZER-based psycho-societal research is briefly summarized, emphasizing the role of the researcher subjects in discovering socially unconscious meaning in social interaction. Finally an outlook to contemporary epistemological issues. LORENZER's approach to theorize and research the subject as a socially produced entity appears as a psycho-societal alternative to mainstream social constructivism.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1203229},

  abstract = {Researcher degrees of freedom refer to arbitrary decisions in the execution and reporting of hypothesis-testing research that allow for many possible outcomes from a single study. Selective reporting of results ( p-hacking) from this “multiverse” of outcomes can inflate effect size estimates and false positive rates. We studied the effects of researcher degrees of freedom and selective reporting using empirical data from extensive multistudy projects in psychology (Registered Replication Reports) featuring 211 samples and 14 dependent variables. We used a counterfactual design to examine what biases could have emerged if the studies (and ensuing meta-analyses) had not been preregistered and could have been subjected to selective reporting based on the significance of the outcomes in the primary studies. Our results show the substantial variability in effect sizes that researcher degrees of freedom can create in relatively standard psychological studies, and how selective reporting of outcomes can alter conclusions and introduce bias in meta-analysis. Despite the typically thousands of outcomes appearing in the multiverses of the 294 included studies, only in about 30\% of studies did significant effect sizes in the hypothesized direction emerge. We also observed that the effect of a particular researcher degree of freedom was inconsistent across replication studies using the same protocol, meaning multiverse analyses often fail to replicate across samples. We recommend hypothesis-testing researchers to preregister their preferred analysis and openly report multiverse analysis. We propose a descriptive index (underlying multiverse variability) that quantifies the robustness of results across alternative ways to analyze the data.},

  abstract = {A complex systems approach to psychopathology proposes that general principles lie in the dynamic patterns of psychopathology, which are not restricted to specific psychological processes like symptoms or affect. Hence, it must be possible to find general change profiles in time series data of fully personalized questionnaires. In the current study, we examined general change profiles in personalized self-ratings and related these to four measures of treatment outcome (International Symptom Rating, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, daily symptom severity and self-reflective capacity). We analyzed data of 404 patients with mood and/or anxiety disorders who completed daily self-ratings on personalized questionnaires during psychotherapy. For each patient, a principal component analysis was applied to the multivariate time series in order to retrieve an univariate person-specific time series. Then, using classification and regression methods, we examined these time series for the presence of general change profiles. The change profile classification yielded the following distribution of patients: no-shift (n = 55; 14\%), gradual-change (n = 52; 13\%), one-shift (n = 233; 58\%), reversed-shift (n = 39; 10\%) and multiple-shifts (n = 25; 6\%). The multiple-shifts group had better treatment outcome than the no-shift group on all outcome measures. The one-shift and gradual-change group had better treatment outcome than the no-shift group on respectively two and three outcome measures. Overall, this study illustrates that person-specific (idiographic) and general (nomothetic) aspects of psychopathology can be integrated in a complex systems approach to psychopathology, which may combine ‘the best of both worlds’.},

This approach, which has already produced novel and valuable insights into the complex nature of psychopathology, often relies on repeated self-ratings of individual patients. So far, it has been unknown whether such self-ratings, the presumed observables of the individual patient as a complex system, actually display complex dynamics. We examine this basic assumption of a complex systems approach to psychopathology by testing repeated self-ratings for three markers of complexity: memory, the presence of (time-varying) short- and long-range temporal correlations; regime shifts, transitions between different dynamic regimes; and sensitive dependence on initial conditions, also known as the “butterfly effect,” the divergence of initially similar trajectories.},

Yet, a theory of psychopathology grounded in the principles of complex adaptive systems is lacking. Here, we present such a theory based on the notion of dynamic patterns: patterns that are formed over time. We propose that psychopathology can be understood as a dynamic pattern that emerges from self-organized interactions between interdependent biopsychosocial processes in a complex adaptive system comprising a person in its environment. Psychopathology is emergent in the sense that it refers to the person-environment system as a whole, and cannot be reduced to specific system parts. Psychopathology as a dynamic pattern is also self-organized, meaning that it arises solely from the interdependencies in the system: the interactions between countless biopsychosocial variables. All possible manifestations of psychopathology will correspond to a wide variety of dynamic patterns. Yet, we propose that the development of these patterns over time can be described by general principles of pattern formation in complex adaptive systems. A discussion of implications for classification, intervention and public health concludes the paper.},

  abstract = {Whereas sudden gains and losses (large shifts in symptom severity) in patients receiving psychotherapy appear abrupt and hence may seem unexpected, hypotheses from complex-systems theory suggest that sudden gains and losses are actually preceded by certain early-warning signals (EWSs). We tested whether EWSs in patients’ daily self-ratings of the psychotherapeutic process predicted future sudden gains and losses. Data were collected from 328 patients receiving psychotherapy for mood disorders who completed daily self-ratings about their therapeutic process using the Therapy Process Questionnaire (TPQ). Sudden gains and losses were classified from the Problem Intensity scale of the TPQ. The other items of the TPQ were used to compute the EWSs. EWSs predicted an increased probability for sudden gains and losses in a 4-day predictive window. These results show that EWSs can be used for real-time prediction of sudden gains and losses in clinical practice.},

This stagnation has led clinical researchers to call for an approach that instead focuses on processes of change and the individual in their particular context. Process-based therapy (PBT) is a general approach representing a model of models, grounded in evolution science, with an emphasis on idiographic methods, network models of case conceptualization, and enhancing wellbeing. In this paper, we describe the theory underlying PBT and present a case study for how to apply PBT tools and principles to deliver process-informed and person-centered evidence-based treatment.

  abstract = {Empirically analyzing empirical evidence One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science. RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {$<$} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/349/6251/aac4716/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size.

  abstract = {Testing for Granger causality relies on estimating the capacity of dynamics in one time series to forecast dynamics in another. The canonical test for such temporal predictive causality is based on fitting multivariate time series models and is cast in the classical null hypothesis testing framework. In this framework, we are limited to rejecting the null hypothesis or failing to reject the null – we can never validly accept the null hypothesis of no Granger causality. This is poorly suited for many common purposes, including evidence integration, feature selection, and other cases where it is useful to express evidence against, rather than for, the existence of an association. Here we derive and implement the Bayes factor for Granger causality in a multilevel modeling framework. This Bayes factor summarizes information in the data in terms of a continuously scaled evidence ratio between the presence of Granger causality and its absence. We also introduce this procedure for the multilevel generalization of Granger causality testing. This facilitates inference when information is scarce or noisy or if we are interested primarily in population-level trends. We illustrate our approach with an application on exploring causal relationships in affect using a daily life study.},

This study examined the influence of time metric precision on model estimation, model interpretation, and parameter estimate accuracy in bivariate LCS (BLCS) models through simulation. Longitudinal data were generated with a panel study where assessments took place during a given time window with variation in start time and measurement lag. The data were analyzed using precise time metric, where variation in time was accounted for, and then analyzed using coarse time metric indicating only that the assessment took place during the time window. Results indicated that models estimated using the coarse time metric resulted in biased parameter estimates as well as larger standard errors and larger variances and covariances for intercept and slope. In particular, the coupling parameter estimates—which are unique to BLCS models—were biased with larger standard errors. An illustrative example of longitudinal bivariate relations between math and reading achievement in a nationally representative survey of children is then used to demonstrate how results and conclusions differ when using time metrics of varying precision. Implications and future directions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Regularized continuous time structural equation models are proposed to address two recent challenges in longitudinal research: Unequally spaced measurement occasions and high model complexity. Unequally spaced measurement occasions are part of most longitudinal studies, sometimes intentionally (e.g., in experience sampling methods) sometimes unintentionally (e.g., due to missing data). Yet, prominent dynamic models, such as the autoregressive cross-lagged model, assume equally spaced measurement occasions. If this assumption is violated parameter estimates can be biased, potentially leading to false conclusions. Continuous time structural equation models (CTSEM) resolve this problem by taking the exact time point of a measurement into account. This allows for any arbitrary measurement scheme. We combine CTSEM with LASSO and adaptive LASSO regularization. Such regularization techniques are especially promising for the increasingly complex models in psychological research, the most prominent example being network models with often dozens or hundreds of parameters. Here, LASSO regularization can reduce the risk of overfitting and simplify the model interpretation. In this article we highlight unique challenges in regularizing continuous time dynamic models, such as standardization or the optimization of the objective function, and offer different solutions. Our approach is implemented in the R (R Core Team, 2022) package regCtsem. We demonstrate the use of regCtsem in a simulation study, showing that the proposed regularization improves the parameter estimates, especially in small samples. The approach correctly eliminates true-zero parameters while retaining true-nonzero parameters. We present two empirical examples and end with a discussion on current limitations and future research directions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

AIM: To study the bidirectional relationship between physical activity and sleep in daily life by making repeated measurements in depressed and non-depressed people. METHOD: Every day for 30 consecutive days each depressed (N = 27) and non-depressed (N = 27) participant in our study had to complete an electronic questionnaire relating to subjective sleep quality and sleep duration and were required to wear an accelerometer that recorded physical activity. RESULTS: Multi-level analysis showed that an increase in subjective sleep duration resulted in a decrease in physical activity. The differences between individuals with regard to the direction and strength of this relationship were significant. Changes in physical activity did not predict changes in sleep quality or sleep duration. We did not find any differences in the relationships for depressed and non-depressed participants. CONCLUSION: Change in sleep duration predicts change in physical activity, although there was significant heterogeneity in the results for individuals. Our findings underline the importance of further research and of the development of interventions that are tailored to the precise needs of the individual patient.},

  abstract = {Supervised machine learning (ML) is becoming an influential analytical method in psychology and other social sciences. However, theoretical ML concepts and predictive-modeling techniques are not yet widely taught in psychology programs. This tutorial is intended to provide an intuitive but thorough primer and introduction to supervised ML for psychologists in four consecutive modules. After introducing the basic terminology and mindset of supervised ML, in Module 1, we cover how to use resampling methods to evaluate the performance of ML models (bias-variance trade-off, performance measures, k-fold cross-validation). In Module 2, we introduce the nonlinear random forest, a type of ML model that is particularly user-friendly and well suited to predicting psychological outcomes. Module 3 is about performing empirical benchmark experiments (comparing the performance of several ML models on multiple data sets). Finally, in Module 4, we discuss the interpretation of ML models, including permutation variable importance measures, effect plots (partial-dependence plots, individual conditional-expectation profiles), and the concept of model fairness. Throughout the tutorial, intuitive descriptions of theoretical concepts are provided, with as few mathematical formulas as possible, and followed by code examples using the mlr3 and companion packages in R. Key practical-analysis steps are demonstrated on the publicly available PhoneStudy data set (N = 624), which includes more than 1,800 variables from smartphone sensing to predict Big Five personality trait scores. The article contains a checklist to be used as a reminder of important elements when performing, reporting, or reviewing ML analyses in psychology. Additional examples and more advanced concepts are demonstrated in online materials (https://osf.io/9273g/).},

  abstract = {Many studies of future climate change take an ensemble modeling approach in which simulations of future conditions are produced with multiple climate models (or model versions), rather than just one. These ensemble studies are of two main types—perturbed-physics and multimodel—which investigate different sources of uncertainty about future climate change. Increasingly, methods are being applied which assign probabilities to future changes in climate on the basis of the set of projections (the ensemble) produced in a perturbed-physics or multimodel study. This has prompted debate over both the appropriate interpretation of ensembles as well as how best to communicate uncertainty about future climate change to decision makers; such communication is a primary impetus for ensemble studies. The intuition persists that agreement among ensemble members about the extent of future climate change warrants increased confidence in the projected changes, but in practice the significance of this robustness is difficult to gauge. Priority topics for future research include how to design ensemble studies that take better account of structural uncertainty, how to weight ensemble members and how to improve the process by which ensemble studies are synthesized with other information in expert assessments.

These methods describe nomothetic trends in idiographic processes by pooling intraindividual information across individuals to inform group-level inference or vice versa. The current work introduces a novel "idio-thetic" model: the subgrouped chain graphical vector autoregression (scGVAR). The scGVAR is unique in its ability to identify subgroups of individuals who share common dynamic network structures in both lag(1) and contemporaneous effects. Results from Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the scGVAR shows promise over similar approaches when clusters of individuals differ in their contemporaneous dynamics and in showing increased sensitivity in detecting nuanced group differences while keeping Type-I error rates low. In contrast, a competing approach–the Alternating Least Squares VAR (ALS VAR) performs well when groups were separated by larger distances. Further considerations are provided regarding applications of the ALS VAR and scGVAR on real data and the strengths and limitations of both methods.},

A consistent finding from studying atomic bonds to psychopathy is that variables and people seldom cooperate with our attempts to fit them into neat clusters. The argument for the current work is that ambiguities in group membership may be more informative than we acknowledge, and warrant adoption of "fuzzy" methodologies that can explicitly quantify these uncertainties. Here, we describe fuzzy community detection methods which permit variables to belong to multiple communities by varying degrees rather than restricting their membership to "on" or "off", and contrast them with discrete forms of community detection. In line with recent calls for dimensional approaches to the study of psychopathology, we discuss how the application of these fuzzy methodologies may inform the study of psychological symptoms and subjects. In particular, we discuss how ambiguous symptoms could serve as the bridges between psychopathologies and how ambiguous subjects could exhibit dynamics relevant for treatment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between depressive symptoms and subjective and objective measures of sleep in community-dwelling older men. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Six U.S. clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand fifty-one men aged 67 and older. MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale and categorized as 0 to 2 (normal, referent group), 3 to 5 (some depressive symptoms), and 6 to 15 (depressed); objective sleep measures ascertained using wrist actigraphy (mean duration 5.2 nights); and subjective sleep measures assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. RESULTS: There was a strong multivariable-adjusted association between level of depressive symptoms and subjective sleep disturbances (P-trend {$<$}.001). For example, the odds of reporting poor sleep quality were 3.7 times (95\% confidence interval (CI)=2.5–5.3) higher for depressed men as for normal men, and 2.1 times (95\% CI=1.7–2.6) higher for men with some depressive symptoms. For objectively measured sleep disturbances, men with more depressive symptoms had greater odds of sleep latency of 1 hour or more (P-trend=.006). There was no association between level of depressive symptoms and sleep efficiency, awakening after sleep onset, multiple long-wake episodes, or total sleep time. Excluding 384 men taking antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or other anxiolytic or hypnotics did not alter the results. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms have a strong, graded association with subjective sleep disturbances and are moderately associated with objectively measured prolonged sleep latency. Future studies should address temporality of depression and sleep disturbances.},

Depressive symptoms were reassessed an average of 3.4 ± 0.5 y later.Of the 2,510 men without evidence of depression at baseline, 116 (4.6\%) were depressed (GDS ≥ 6) at the follow-up examination. After adjusting for multiple potential confounders, including baseline depressive symptoms (GDS 0-5), there was evidence of an association between poor self-reported sleep quality and higher odds of being depressed at follow-up (multivariable odds ratio [MOR] = 1.53, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-2.33). In age- and site-adjusted models, objectively measured reduced sleep efficiency (odds ratio [OR] = 1.88, 95\% CI 1.13-3.13), prolonged sleep latency (OR = 1.77, 95\% CI 1.04-3.00), greater nighttime wakefulness (OR = 1.48, 95\% CI 1.01-2.18) and multiple long-wake episodes (OR = 1.69, 95\% CI 1.15-2.47) were associated with increased odds of depression at follow-up, but these associations were attenuated and no longer significant after further adjustment for number of depressive symptoms at baseline. Self-reported excessive daytime sleepiness and objectively measured total sleep time were not associated with depression status at follow-up. Excluding baseline antidepressant users from the analyses did not alter the results.Among nondepressed older men, poor self-reported sleep quality was associated with increased odds of depression several years later. Associations between objectively measured sleep disturbances (e.g., reduced sleep efficiency, prolonged sleep latency, greater nighttime wakefulness, and greater long-wake episodes) and depression several years later were largely explained by a greater burden of depressive symptoms at baseline.}

We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

  abstract = {Depressed patients present with motor activity abnormalities, which can be easily recorded using actigraphy. The extent to which actigraphically recorded motor activity may predict inpatient clinical course and hospital discharge remains unknown. Participants were recruited from the acute psychiatric inpatient ward at Hospital Rey Juan Carlos (Madrid, Spain). They wore miniature wrist wireless inertial sensors (actigraphs) throughout the admission. We modeled activity levels against the normalized length of admission—‘Progress Towards Discharge’ (PTD)—using a Hierarchical Generalized Linear Regression Model. The estimated date of hospital discharge based on early measures of motor activity and the actual hospital discharge date were compared by a Hierarchical Gaussian Process model. Twenty-three depressed patients (14 females, age: 50.17\,±\,12.72~years) were recruited. Activity levels increased during the admission (mean slope of the linear function: 0.12\,±\,0.13). For n\,=\,18 inpatients (78.26\%) hospitalised for at least 7~days, the mean error of Prediction of Hospital Discharge Date at day 7 was 0.231\,±\,22.98~days (95\% CI 14.222–14.684). These n\,=\,18 patients were predicted to need, on average, 7 more days in hospital (for a total length of stay of 14~days) (PTD\,=\,0.53). Motor activity increased during the admission in this sample of depressed patients and early patterns of actigraphically recorded activity allowed for accurate prediction of hospital discharge date.},

  abstract = {Background Although accumulated evidence suggests that fluctuations in depressed mood are common among individuals with depression, and may be associated with onset, duration, and severity of illness, a systematic appraisal of putative predictors of depressed mood is lacking. Methods A systematic search for relevant studies in the literature was conducted using PsycInfo and PubMed databases via EbscoHost in February 2016. The search was limited to articles using the experience sampling method, an approach suitable for capturing in situ fluctuations in mood states. Results Forty-two studies met inclusion criteria for the review, from which three key risk factors (poor sleep, stress, and significant life events) and two protective factors (physical activity and quality of social interactions) were identified. The majority of papers supported concurrent and lagged associations between these putative protective/risk factors and depressed mood. Limitations Despite support for each of the proposed protective/risk factors, few studies evaluated multiple factors in the same study. Moreover, the time course for the effects of these predictors on depressed mood remains largely unknown. Conclusions The present review identified several putative risk and protective factors for depressed mood. A review of the literature suggests that poor sleep, negative social interactions, and stressful negative events may temporally precede spikes in depressed mood. In contrast, exercise and positive social interactions have been shown to predict subsequent declines in depressed mood. However, the lack of multivariate models in which the unique contributions of various predictors could be evaluated means that the current state of knowledge prevents firm conclusions about which factors are most predictive of depressed mood. More complex modeling of these effects is necessary in order to provide insights useful for clinical treatment in daily life of the depressed mood component of depressive disorders.},

  abstract = {To advance the theoretical foundation of incorporating response times (RTs) into diagnostic classification models (DCMs), this study attempts to further derive, test and illustrate a generalized modeling framework (known as the JVRT-LCDM) that can simultaneously analyze response accuracy and differential speediness based on an existing method (Zhan et al., British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, 71(2), 262–286, 2018). The JVRT-LCDM not only provides fine-grained diagnostic feedback without strict model constraints but also clarifies the specific speed trajectory of individuals. Moreover, some existing models from psychometric literatures are included in the JVRT-LCDM as special cases. The feasibility of the JVRT-LCDM is investigated via a Monte Carlo simulation study using a Bayesian estimation scheme, and two empirical datasets are then analyzed to illustrate the applicability of the JVRT-LCDM in practice. The results indicate that (1) as a generalized and flexible model, the JVRT-LCDM realizes high correct classification rates and accurate speed parameter recovery; (2) the JVRT-LCDM outperforms the existing models in terms of model-data fit, diagnostic consistency, and estimation of specific individuals in practical cognitive diagnosis assessments; and (3) the JVRT-LCDM provides reliable evidence for nonconstant speed modeling.},

  abstract = {Using 58 audio-recorded sessions of psychoanalysis (coming from two analysts and three patients) as data and conversation analysis as method, this article shows how psychoanalysts deal with patients' responses to interpretations. After the analyst offers an interpretation, the patient responds. At that point (in the third position), the analysts recurrently modify the tenor of the description from what it was in the patients' responses. They intensify the emotional valence of the description, or they reveal layers of the patients' experience other than those that the patient reported. Both are usually accomplished in an implicit, nonmarked way, and they discreetly index possible opportunities for the patients to modify their understandings of the initial interpretation. Although the patients usually do not fully endorse these modifications, the data available suggest that during the sessions that follow, the participants do work with the aspects of patients' experience that the analyst highlighted. In discussion, it is suggested that actions that the psychoanalysts produce in therapy, such as choices of turn design in third position, may be informed by working understanding of the minds and mental conflicts of individual patients, alongside the more general therapeutic model of the mind they hold to.},

This study focuses on interpretations that make links between different domains of the patient's experience (childhood, current everyday life, and the analyst–analysand relationship). The analyst is actively working to create a match between the different domains of experience by shaping the description of the patient's experience to display the “sameness” of the connected experiences. There are 2 loci for the analyst's work to create the match: One is the lexical choice within the interpretative statements, and the other is the sequence structure in the discussion that precedes the interpretations.

  abstract = {Psychoanalytic interpretation is normally understood as a sequence of two utterances: the analyst gives an interpretation and the patient responds to it. This paper suggests that, in the interpretative sequence, there is also a third utterance where psychoanalytic work takes place. This third interpretative turn involves the analyst’s action after the patient’s response to the interpretation. Using conversation analysis as method in the examination of audio‐recorded psychoanalytic sessions, the paper will explicate the psychoanalytic work that gets done in third interpretative turns. Through it, the analyst takes a stance towards the patient’s understandings of the interpretation, which are shown in the patient’s response to the interpretation. The third interpretative turns on one hand ratify and accept the patient’s understandings, but, in addition to that, they also introduce a shift of perspective relative to them. In most cases, the shift of perspective is implicit but sometimes it is made explicit. The shifts of perspective bring to the foreground aspects or implications of the interpretation that were not incorporated in the patient’s response. They recast the description of the patient’s experience by showing new layers or more emotional intensity in it. The results are discussed in the light of Faimberg’s concept of listening to listening and Schlesinger’s concept of follow‐up interpretation.},

However, the efficacy of light therapy in treating patients with non-seasonal depression remains inconclusive.                                         Aims               To provide the current state of evidence for efficacy of light therapy in non-seasonal depressive disorders.                                         Method               Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and CENTRAL from their inception to September 2015. Study selection, data abstraction and risk of bias assessment were independently conducted in duplicate. Meta-analyses were performed to provide a summary statistic for the included RCTs. The reporting of this systematic review follows the PRISMA guidelines.                                         Results                                A meta-analysis including 881 participants from 20 RCTs demonstrated a beneficial effect of light therapy in non-seasonal depression (standardised mean difference in depression score −0.41 (95\% CI −0.64 to −0.18)). This estimate was associated with significant heterogeneity (                 I                 2                 =60\%,                 P                 =0.0003) that was not sufficiently explained by subgroup analyses.

Conclusions               The overall quality of evidence is poor due to high risk of bias and inconsistency. However, considering that light therapy has minimal side-effects and our meta-analysis demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients achieved a clinically significant response, light therapy may be effective for patients with non-seasonal depression and can be a helpful additional therapeutic intervention for depression.},

Sensor data has been linked to moment-to-moment psychological symptoms and mood of individuals and thus could alleviate the burden associated with repeated measurement of symptoms. Additionally, psychological care could be improved by predicting moments of high psychopathology and providing immediate interventions. Current research assumes that the relationship between sensor data and psychological symptoms stays constant over time or changes constantly: Models are trained on all past data or a fixed window. Yet, fixing this window can negatively impact prediction accuracy if the underlying rate of change is varying. We aim to develop a methodology that adapts to the underlying rate of change by combining models with different training windows. Specifically, the we adapted Bayesian model stacking for time series data and tested it on simulated data. We found that for most shapes, the model weights adapted well to the underlying change given a large enough sample size. Predictive performance however was not improved compared to selecting the best fixed window size. As different window sizes are rarely compared, we conclude that the method can still be useful in selecting the single best training window.},

Each series is Box-Cox transformed, and decomposed by Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL); then bootstrapping is applied on the remainder series before the trend and seasonality are added back, and the transformation reversed to create bootstrapped versions of the series. Subsequently, they apply automatic exponential smoothing on the original series and the bootstrapped versions of the series, with the final forecast being the equal-weight combination across all forecasts. In this study we attempt to address the question: why does bagging for time series forecasting work? We assume three sources of uncertainty (model uncertainty, data uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty) and we separately explore the benefits of bagging for time series forecasting for each one of them. Our analysis considers 4,004 time series (from the M- and M3-competitions) and two families of models. The results show that the benefits of bagging predominantly originate from the model uncertainty: the fact that different models might be selected as optimal for the bootstrapped series. As such, a suitable weighted combination of the most suitable models should be preferred to selecting a single model.},

First, we show how these measures can be easily estimated within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, the posterior distribution for these measures can be obtained through Gibbs sampling – for coefficients α, λ2, and the glb one can sample the covariance matrix from an inverse Wishart distribution; for coefficient ω one samples the conditional posterior distributions from a single-factor CFA-model. Simulations show that – under relatively uninformative priors – the 95\% Bayesian credible intervals are highly similar to the 95\% frequentist bootstrap confidence intervals. In addition, the posterior distribution can be used to address practically relevant questions, such as “what is the probability that the reliability of this test is between .70 and .90?”, or, “how likely is it that the reliability of this test is higher than .80?” In general, the use of a posterior distribution highlights the inherent uncertainty with respect to the estimation of reliability measures.},

  abstract = {Stability is a major requirement to draw reliable conclusions when interpreting results from supervised statistical learning. In this article, we present a general framework for assessing and comparing the stability of results, which can be used in real-world statistical learning applications as well as in simulation and benchmark studies. We use the framework to show that stability is a property of both the algorithm and the data-generating process. In particular, we demonstrate that unstable algorithms (such as recursive partitioning) can produce stable results when the functional form of the relationship between the predictors and the response matches the algorithm. Typical uses of the framework in practical data analysis would be to compare the stability of results generated by different candidate algorithms for a dataset at hand or to assess the stability of algorithms in a benchmark study. Code to perform the stability analyses is provided in the form of an R package. Supplementary material for this article is available online.},

Results from idiographic work may provide a possible resolution of the therapist’s dilemma—the problem of treating an individual using information gathered via group-level research. Due to advances in data collection and time series methodology, there has been increasing interest in using idiographic designs to answer clinical questions. Although time series methods have been well-studied outside the field of clinical psychology, there is limited direction on how clinicians can use such models to inform their clinical practice. In this primer, we collate decades of published and word-of-mouth information on idiographic designs, measurement, and modeling. We aim to provide an initial guide on the theoretical and practical considerations that we urge interested clinicians to consider before conducting idiographic work of their own.},

Much of our current research attempts to indirectly investigate individual-level, or idiographic, psychological processes via group-based, or nomothetic, designs. However, results from nomothetic research do not necessarily translate to the individual-level. In this review, we discuss how idiographic analyses can be integrated into psychotherapy and psychotherapy research. We examine and review key statistical methods for conducting idiographic analyses. These methods include factor-based and vector autoregressive approaches using longitudinal data. The theoretical framework behind each approach is reviewed and critically evaluated. Empirical examples of each approach are discussed, with the aim of helping interested readers consider how they may use idiographic methods to analyze longitudinal data and psychological processes. Finally, we conclude by citing key limitations of the idiographic approach, calling for greater development of these analyses to ease their successful integration into clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Trait ruminators exhibit significantly higher levels of sleep disturbance than those without this cognitive vulnerability. However, support for the sleep disruptive effects of state rumination, especially in the presleep period, is rare, and hindered by methodological drawbacks such as self-report and single night assays of sleep. Finally, despite the pervasiveness of the ruminative response style among individuals with depression, the association between rumination and sleep disturbance has not been explored in this population. The present study employed a week-long daily sampling approach to examine the effects of naturally occurring pre-sleep rumination on self-reported and actigraphy-based sleep among individuals with high depressive symptomatology. Methods: Forty-two university students (19.6 ± 3.2 yo;73.8\% female), all of whom reported at least moderate levels of depressive symptoms, completed a short questionnaire after waking each morning for seven days. On this questionnaire, they self-reported sleep indices from the previous night and levels of engagement in presleep rumination. Sleep was also monitored throughout this period via wrist actigraphy. Hierarchical-linearmodeling was used to examine the association between nightly rumination and sleep. Results: Nightly variations in pre-sleep rumination were predictive of significantly longer actigraphy- and diarybased sleep onset latency (SOL). Notably, a 1 SD increase on the pre-sleep rumination scale was associated with an approximately 7 minute increase in actigraphy-based SOL, even after controlling for baseline sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: These data offer compelling evidence for the impact of pre-sleep rumination on sleep onset, providing insight into one potential mechanism that triggers sleep disturbance among individuals with depressive symptoms. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The field of positive psychology has burgeoned since its formal inception with Martin Seligman’s 1998 APA presidential address. Aimed at better baking the positive half of the psychology “cake”, the gains in research and practice over the past decade and a half have been substantial. Among the chief reasons for the rapid growth and development in this field is the express emphasis on a positivistic scientific methodology. While this methodology has undoubtedly contributed much to the evolution and growth of the field, the empirical emphasis has arguably resulted in the concomitant neglect of the more qualitative complexities of optimal human functioning. The present paper contributes to the discussion regarding the role of method in the field of positive psychology and, using as case studies two papers from the field of phenomenology, argues specifically for the utility of phenomenological psychological methods in the baking of the metaphorical psychology cake. The case studies effectively serve to illustrate the manner in which phenomenological methods, through their focus on rich description and resistance to an interpretative framework, are condusive to contributing to methodological pluralism within positive psychology and thereby providing additional means whereby not only to continue the baking of the positive psychology cake, but, more particularly, to ensure that it is baked thoroughly by adjusting the oven’s heat to the optimal level.},

We propose such an algorithm, called Walktrap, which runs in time O(mn2) and space O(n2) in the worst case, and in time O(n2 log n) and space O(n2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph). Extensive comparison tests show that our algorithm surpasses previously proposed ones concerning the quality of the obtained community structures and that it stands among the best ones concerning the running time.},

Models can contain multiple shape constrained and unconstrained terms as well as shape constrained multi-dimensional smooths. The constraints considered are on the sign of the first or/and the second derivatives of the smooth terms. A key advantage of the approach is that it facilitates efficient estimation of smoothing parameters as an integral part of model estimation, via GCV or AIC, and numerically robust algorithms for this are presented. We also derive simulation free approximate Bayesian confidence intervals for the smooth components, which are shown to achieve close to nominal coverage probabilities. Applications are presented using real data examples including the risk of disease in relation to proximity to municipal incinerators and the association between air pollution and health.},

  abstract = {Causal inference regarding a hypothesized mediation mechanism relies on the assumptions that there are no omitted pretreatment confounders (i.e., confounders preceding the treatment) of the treatment–mediator, treatment–outcome, and mediator–outcome relationships, and there are no posttreatment confounders (i.e., confounders affected by the treatment) of the mediator–outcome relationship. It is crucial to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine if a potential violation of the assumptions would easily change analytic conclusions. This article proposes a simulation-based method to assess the sensitivity to unmeasured pretreatment confounding, assuming no posttreatment confounding. It allows one to (a) quantify the strength of an unmeasured pretreatment confounder through its conditional associations with the treatment, mediator, and outcome; (b) simulate the confounder from its conditional distribution; and (c) finally assess its influence on both the point estimation and estimation efficiency by comparing the results before and after adjusting for the simulated confounder in the analysis. The proposed sensitivity analysis strategy can be implemented for any causal mediation analysis method. It is applicable to both randomized experiments and observational studies and to mediators and outcomes of different scales. A visualization tool is provided for vivid representations of the sensitivity analysis results. An R package mediationsens has been developed for researchers to implement the proposed method easily (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mediationsens/index.html).

This paper aims to illustrate a novel framework for conceptualizing, collecting, and analyzing concussion symptom data. To that end, we describe the temporal and structural dynamics of acute concussion symptoms at the individual-patient level. Ten recently concussion adolescents and young adults completed 20 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of post-concussion symptoms. Follow-up assessments were completed at 3 months post-injury. Network modeling revealed marked heterogeneity across participants. In the overall sample, temporal patterns explained the most variance in light sensitivity (48\%) and the least variance in vomiting (5\%). About half of the participants had symptom networks that were sparse after controlling for temporal variation. The other individualized symptom networks were densely interconnected clusters of symptoms. Networks were highly idiosyncratic in nature, yet emotional symptoms (nervousness, emotional, sadness), cognitive symptoms (mental fogginess, slowness), and symptoms of hyperacusis (sensitivity to light, sensitivity to noise) tended to cluster together across participants. Person-specific analytic techniques revealed a number of idiosyncratic features of post-concussion symptomatology. We propose applying this framework to future research to better understand individual differences in concussion recovery.},

There are currently no support or effective intervention therapeutics for individuals with an ED in their everyday life. The aim of this study is to build idiographic machine learning (ML) models to evaluate the performance of physiological recordings to detect individual ED behaviors in naturalistic settings.MethodsFrom an ongoing study (Final N = 120), we piloted the ability for ML to detect an individual's ED behavioral episodes (e.g. purging) from physiological data in six individuals diagnosed with an ED, all of whom endorsed purging. Participants wore an ambulatory monitor for 30 days and tapped a button to denote ED behavioral episodes. We built idiographic (N = 1) logistic regression classifiers (LRC) ML trained models to identify onset of episodes (\textasciitilde 600 windows) v. baseline (\textasciitilde 571 windows) physiology (Heart Rate, Electrodermal Activity, and Temperature).ResultsUsing physiological data, ML LRC accurately classified on average 91\% of cases, with 92\% specificity and 90\% sensitivity.ConclusionsThis evidence suggests the ability to build idiographic ML models that detect ED behaviors from physiological indices within everyday life with a high level of accuracy. The novel use of ML with wearable sensors to detect physiological patterns of ED behavior pre-onset can lead to just-in-time clinical interventions to disrupt problematic behaviors and promote ED recovery.},

In developing the possibilities, we suggest Molenaar add a statement to the person-specific Manifesto – “In short, the concerns about generalizability commonly leveled at the person-specific paradigm are unfounded and can be fully and completely replaced with discussion and demonstrations of transferability.”},

In addition, the impact of recurring episodes on motor activity is uncertain. In 76 medicated inpatients with major depression (27 with a first episode, 49 with recurrent episodes), continuous wrist actigraphy for 24h and scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) were obtained. In addition, 10 subjects of the sample wore the actigraph over a period of 5 days, in order to assess the reliability of a 1-day measurement. Activity levels were stable over 5 consecutive days. Actigraphic parameters did not differ between patients with a first or a recurrent episode, and quantitative motor activity failed to correlate with the HAMD total score. However, of the motor-related single items of the HAMD, the item activities was associated with motor activity parameters, while the items agitation and retardation were not. Actigraphy is consistent with clinical observation for the item activities. Expert raters may not correctly rate the motor aspects of retardation and agitation in major depression.},

  abstract = {Background. Adolescence is characterized by profound change, including increases in negative emotions. Approximately 84\% of American adolescents own a smartphone, which can continuously and unobtrusively track variables potentially predictive of heightened negative emotions (e.g. activity levels, location, pattern of phone usage). The extent to which builtin smartphone sensors can reliably predict states of elevated negative affect in adolescents is an open question. Methods. Adolescent participants (n = 22; ages 13–18) with low to high levels of depressive symptoms were followed for 15 weeks using a combination of ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and continuously collected passive smartphone sensor data. EMAs probed negative emotional states (i.e. anger, sadness and anxiety) 2–3 times per day every other week throughout the study (total: 1145 EMA measurements). Smartphone accelerometer, location and device state data were collected to derive 14 discrete estimates of behavior, including activity level, percentage of time spent at home, sleep onset and duration, and phone usage. Results. A personalized ensemble machine learning model derived from smartphone sensor data outperformed other statistical approaches (e.g. linear mixed model) and predicted states of elevated anger and anxiety with acceptable discrimination ability (area under the curve (AUC) = 74\% and 71\%, respectively), but demonstrated more modest discrimination ability for predicting states of high sadness (AUC = 66\%). Conclusions. To the extent that smartphone data could provide reasonably accurate real-time predictions of states of high negative affect in teens, brief ‘just-in-time’ interventions could be immediately deployed via smartphone notifications or mental health apps to alleviate these states.},

  abstract = {Affect dynamics are often studied by means of first-order autoregressive (AR) modeling applied to intensive longitudinal data. A key target in these studies is the AR parameter, which is often tied conceptually to regulatory behavior in the affective process. The data is typically gathered using experience sampling methods, which are designed to pick up on fluctuations in affective variables as they evolve over time in naturalistic settings. In this manuscript, we compare classical time-contingent sampling designs to episode-contingent sampling designs, which initiate sampling when an emotional episode has been signalled. We define emotional episodes as periods where an affective process strays relatively far away from its mean. Compared to time-contingent designs, episode-contingent designs leverage on increased affective variability, which can have beneficial implications for the precision of the ordinary least squares AR effect estimator. Using an extensive simulation study, we attempt to delineate which characteristics of an episode-contingent design are important to consider, and how these characteristics are related to estimation benefits. We conclude that episode-contingent designs can have marked benefits for the precision of the AR effect estimator, and discuss a number of challenges when it comes to implementing episode-contingent designs in practice.},

The processes of interest are typically captured by fitting a VAR(1) model to the resulting data. A crucial question is how to perform sample size planning and thus decide on the number of measurement occasions needed. Although the most popular approach is to perform power analysis, this approach has a number of limitations. Therefore, we propose to consider out-of-sample predictive accuracy as a sample size planning criterion. This criterion quantifies how well the estimated VAR(1) model will allow to predict unseen data from the same individual. To this end, we propose a new simulation-based sample size planning method, called Predictive Accuracy Analysis (PAA), and an associated Shiny App. This approach makes use of a novel predictive accuracy metric that accounts for the multivariate nature of the prediction problem. We showcase how the value of the different VAR(1) model parameters impact power and predictive accuracy-based sample size recommendations using simulated data sets and real data applications. The range of recommended sample sizes is lower for predictive accuracy analysis than for power analysis and for real data the median value of these recommended numbers is lower for the former.},

At the same time, adequate preprocessing of ESM data is crucial: it provides valuable information about the quality of the data and, importantly, helps to resolve issues in the data that may compromise the validity of statistical analyses. To support researchers in properly preprocessing ESM data, we have developed a step-by-step framework, a tutorial website that provides a gallery of R code, an R package, and templates to report the preprocessing steps. Particular attention is given to three different aspects in preprocessing: checking adherence to the study design (e.g., were the momentary questionnaires delivered according to the sampling scheme), examining participants’ response behaviors (e.g., compliance, careless responding), and describing and visualizing the data (e.g., examining distributions of variables).},

This type of data is likely to display a pattern of skewness because of the existence of an upper and lower limit that cannot be exceeded. In the context of factor analysis, when variables are skewed in opposite directions, using normal-theory factor analysis might lead to over-factoring. We propose a Bayesian beta factor model to analyze doubly bounded data. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the normal and beta factor models in the presence of skewed variables. Two Bayesian approaches to model evaluation methods are considered, posterior predictive checking and three information criterion measures (DIC, WAIC, and LOO). The number of estimated factors based on the Bayesian methods is compared for the normal and beta factor models. An application of the model using real data is also presented. We found that the beta factor model constitutes a suitable alternative to analyze data with a pattern of mixed skewness. Posterior predictive checking appears to be a viable option to select the optimal number of factors in Bayesian factor analysis.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models estimate an individual's risk of a particular health outcome. A developed model is a consequence of the development dataset and model-building strategy, including the sample size, number of predictors, and analysis method (e.g., regression or machine learning). We raise the concern that many models are developed using small datasets that lead to instability in the model and its predictions (estimated risks). We define four levels of model stability in estimated risks moving from the overall mean to the individual level. Through simulation and case studies of statistical and machine learning approaches, we show instability in a model's estimated risks is often considerable, and ultimately manifests itself as miscalibration of predictions in new data. Therefore, we recommend researchers always examine instability at the model development stage and propose instability plots and measures to do so. This entails repeating the model-building steps (those used to develop the original prediction model) in each of multiple (e.g., 1000) bootstrap samples, to produce multiple bootstrap models, and deriving (i) a prediction instability plot of bootstrap model versus original model predictions; (ii) the mean absolute prediction error (mean absolute difference between individuals’ original and bootstrap model predictions), and (iii) calibration, classification, and decision curve instability plots of bootstrap models applied in the original sample. A case study illustrates how these instability assessments help reassure (or not) whether model predictions are likely to be reliable (or not), while informing a model's critical appraisal (risk of bias rating), fairness, and further validation requirements.},

EMA has advantages over traditional surveys, such as increasing ecological validity. However, especially prolonged data collection can burden participants by disrupting their everyday activities. Consequently, EMA studies can have comparably high rates of missing data and face problems of compliance. Giving participants access to their data via accessible feedback reports, as seen in citizen science initiatives, may increase participant motivation. Existing frameworks to generate such reports focus on single individuals in clinical settings and do not scale well to large datasets. Here, we introduce FRED (Feedback Reports on EMA Data) to tackle the challenge of providing personalized reports to many participants. FRED is an interactive online tool in which participants can explore their own personalized data reports. We showcase FRED using data from the~WARN-D study, where 867 participants were queried for 85 consecutive days with four daily and one weekly survey, resulting in up to 352 observations per participant. FRED includes descriptive statistics, time-series visualizations, and network analyses on selected EMA variables. Participants can access the reports online as part of a Shiny app, developed via the R programming language. We make the code and infrastructure of FRED available in the hope that it will be useful for both research and clinical settings, given that it can be flexibly adapted to the needs of other projects with the goal of generating personalized data reports.},

All studies used an ESM design of 10 beeps per day over 4 to 6 days. Overall compliance was 86\% (to beeps where a subject was compliant at the previous beep). Results indicated that participants who reported higher positive affect overall were more compliant. Feeling disturbed by a beep, being outside the home, medication use, or longer inter-prompt interval decreased the chances of compliance to the subsequent beep. While participants with depression tended to be more compliant, chances to be compliant decreased in the evenings and over the course of the study days. When more beeps were missed consecutively, the chances to miss the subsequent beep increased. Findings suggest that disturbance of the beep, being outside the home, medication use, and inter-prompt interval might decrease the chances of compliance to the subsequent beep.},

  abstract = {Background The nature of sleep-wake abnormalities in individuals with mental disorders remains unclear. The present study aimed to examine the differences in objective ambulatory measures of the sleep-wake and activity cycles across young people with anxiety, mood or psychotic disorders. Methods Participants underwent several days of actigraphy monitoring. We divided participants into 5 groups (control, anxiety disorder, unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder) according to primary diagnosis. Results We enrolled 342 participants aged 12–35 years in our study: 41 healthy controls, 56 with anxiety disorder, 135 with unipolar depression, 80 with bipolar disorder and 30 with psychotic disorders. Compared with the control group, sleep onset tended to occur later in the anxiety, depression and bipolar groups; sleep offset occurred later in all primary diagnosis groups; the sleep period was longer in the anxiety, bipolar and psychosis groups; total sleep time was longer in the psychosis group; and sleep efficiency was lower in the depression group, with a similar tendency for the anxiety and bipolar groups. Sleep parameters were significantly more variable in patient subgroups than in controls. Cosinor analysis revealed delayed circadian activity profiles in the anxiety and bipolar groups and abnormal circadian curve in the psychosis group. Limitations Although statistical analyses controlled for age, the sample included individuals from preadolescence to adulthood. Most participants from the primary diagnosis subgroups were taking psychotropic medications, and a large proportion had other comorbid mental disorders. Conclusion Our findings suggest that delayed and disorganized sleep offset times are common in young patients with various mental disorders. However, other sleep-wake cycle disturbances appear to be more prominent in broad diagnostic categories.},

  abstract = {Abnormalities in circadian rhythms have been reported in people with mood disorders, but these abnormalities are marked by considerable inter-individual variability. This study aimed to identify pathophysiological subgroups on the basis of circadian markers and evaluate how these subgroups relate to psychiatric profiles. Thirty-five young adults (18–31 years old) receiving clinical care for unipolar depressive disorders and 15 healthy controls took part to this study. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Young Mania rating scale were used to evaluate the severity of mood symptoms in participants with depressive disorders. All participant underwent ambulatory sleep monitoring with actigraphy for about 12 days before attending a laboratory-based chronobiological assessment which included repeated salivary samples to determine dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and continuous core body temperature (CBT) monitoring using an ingestible temperature sensor. Cluster analyses were conducted across all participants to identify subgroups with consistent circadian timing profiles based on DLMO and the nocturnal minima of CBT. Two clusters were identified: ‘delayed’ and ‘conventional timing’ circadian phase. Descriptive analyses showed that the delayed cluster was characterised by abnormal time relationships between circadian phase markers and the sleep–wake cycle. Importantly, individuals from the delayed cluster had worse depression severity (t(28)\,=\,−2.7, p\,=\,0.011) and hypomanic symptoms (Z\,=\,−2.2, p\,=\,0.041) than their peers with conventional circadian timing. These findings suggest that delayed and disorganised circadian rhythms may be linked to worse psychiatric profiles in young people with depressive disorders.},

Paul Meehl raised this very concern more than 40 years ago. Yet in the ensuing decades, little has improved. We aim to chart a better path forward for psychological theory by revisiting Meehl’s criticisms, his proposed solution, and the reasons his solution failed to meaningfully change the status of psychological theory. We argue that Meehl identified serious shortcomings in our evaluation of psychological theories and that his proposed solution would substantially strengthen theory testing. However, we also argue that Meehl failed to provide researchers with the tools necessary to construct the kinds of rigorous theories his approach required. To advance psychological theory, we must equip researchers with tools that allow them to better generate, evaluate, and develop their theories. We argue that formal theories provide this much-needed set of tools, equipping researchers with tools for thinking, evaluating explanation, enhancing measurement, informing theory development, and promoting the collaborative construction of psychological theories.},

In addition, we turn our attention to the next decade of the network approach and propose critical avenues for future research in each of these domains.

Initially, network analysis was motivated in part by the thought that it can be used for hypothesis generation. Although the customary approach for network modeling is inherently exploratory, we argue that there is untapped potential for confirmatory hypothesis testing.  In this work, we bring to fruition the potential of Gaussian graphical models for generating testable hypotheses. This is accomplished by merging exploratory and confirmatory analyses into a cohesive framework built around Bayesian hypothesis testing of partial correlations. We first present a motivating example based on a customary, exploratory analysis, where it is made clear how information encoded by the conditional (in)dependence structure can be used to formulate hypotheses. Building upon this foundation, we then provide several empirical examples that unify exploratory and confirmatory testing in psychopathology symptom networks. In particular,  we (1) estimate exploratory graphs; (2) derive hypotheses based on the most central structures; and (3) test those hypotheses in a confirmatory setting. Our confirmatory results uncovered an intricate web of relations, including an order to edge weights within comorbidity networks. This illuminates the rich and informative inferences that can be drawn with the proposed approach. We conclude with recommendations for applied researchers, in addition to discussing how our methodology answers recent calls to begin developing formal models related to the conditional (in)dependence structure of psychological networks.},

In this study, we examined person-centered relationships between social media use and depression symptoms by using a secondary analysis of a publicly available experience sampling dataset (Aalbers et al., 2019). Dutch undergraduate students (N = 125) reported PSMU, ASMU, and depression symptoms 7 times daily for 14 days. We (a) visualized interindividual variability in temporal associations between social media use and individual depression symptoms, (b) compared the aggregate network model to idiographic models, and (c) determined the distribution of person-specific temporal associations between PSMU, ASMU, and depression symptoms. Overall, we found that associations between social media use and depression symptoms differed substantially from individual to individual in both strength and kind. In addition, PSMU and ASMU were very weakly to weakly associated with depression symptoms for most individuals. Future work should examine the differential impact that social media have on our well-being, and how their effects may differ depending on our demographic characteristics, personality traits, and usage patterns.},

As a consequence, researchers may not know how to properly test them and may potentially run analyses that reliably return the wrong answer to their research question. We discuss three major issues regarding the prediction and interpretation of interactions. First, interactions can be removable in the sense that they appear or disappear depending on scaling decisions, with consequences for a variety of situations (e.g., binary or categorical outcomes, bounded scales with floor and ceiling effects). Second, interactions may be conceptualized as changes in slope or changes in correlations, and because these two phenomena do not necessarily coincide, researchers might draw wrong conclusions. Third, interactions may or may not be causally identified, and this determines which interpretations are valid. Researchers who remain unaware of these distinctions might accidentally analyze their data in a manner that returns the technically correct answer to the wrong question. We illustrate all issues with examples from psychology and issue recommendations for how to best address them in a productive manner.},

We discuss why reversing arrows or comparing model fit indices cannot tell us which model is the right one, and how tests of conditional independence can at least tell us where our model goes wrong. Causal modeling practices in psychology are far from optimal but may be kept alive by domain norms which demand that every article makes some novel claim about processes and boundary conditions.

  abstract = {This study is the first to examine the latent structure of individual differences reflected in the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; C. George, N. Kaplan, \& M. Main, 1985), a commonly used and wellvalidated measure designed to assess an adult’s current state of mind regarding childhood experiences with caregivers. P. E. Meehl’s (1995) taxometric methods (i.e., MAXCOV-HITMAX) were applied to data from 504 AAIs. Analyses revealed that the variation underlying secure versus dismissing states of mind was more consistent with a dimensional than a taxonic model. (Taxometric analyses of preoccupation were indeterminate.) In addition, variation in secure adults’ (n ϭ 278) reports about their early experiences revealed little evidence for qualitative groups of earned- and continuous-secures. Rather, the inferred life experiences of secure adults appeared to be distributed continuously. Findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications regarding the phenomenon of earned-security specifically and variation underlying secure and insecure states of mind more generally. The consequences of these analyses for AAI reliability training and coding are also explored.},

We investigated the patterns of responses to different dilemma types in healthy participants and present evidence that some URs to sacrificial dilemmas are morally motivated, as indicated by their empathic concern (EC) or primary psychopathy (PP) scores. In study 1 (N = 230) we tested students with four categories of sacrificial dilemmas featuring innocent victims. In study 2 (N = 590) we tested students with two categories of sacrificial dilemmas and two “real-world” moral dilemmas, where the agent can improve the lot of strangers by making a personal sacrifice. Results in both studies showed no decreased harm aversion in a pattern where the only UR is to the sacrificial dilemma where the number of saved people is very high, and significantly lower harm aversion only in the pattern of all-deontological respondents in Study 2. The analysis by response patterns allowed a better discrimination of the moral motivations of participants and showed that at least some of them express moral concerns in their URs.},

Although the role of baseline physical activity as a risk factor for emerging depression has been recently reviewed, there has been no systematic review of the literature to assess the reverse relationship. We reviewed the results of longitudinal studies in the world's literature that have studied the effect of baseline depression on ensuing levels of physical activity. Measures MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINHAL Plus, Health Source: Nursing Academic Edition and Cochrane databases were searched from 1959 to 2008 with a focus on depression, sedentary lifestyle and exercise. Published longitudinal studies in English and more than 100 patients were included. Results Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria, eight of which reported that baseline depression was significantly associated with subsequent sedentary lifestyle or poor adherence to the physical exercise regimens recommended by physicians after a coronary event. However, the studies used different depression scales and physical activity outcome measures, and varied a great deal in the range of potential confounders they controlled for. In addition, there were only three studies that were specifically designed to assess the role of baseline depression on the subsequent level of physical activity. Conclusions Baseline depression may be a significant risk factor for development of sedentary lifestyle or decreased level of physical exercise. Future studies should examine mechanisms by which depression may lead to decline in activity.},

  abstract = {Objective~         Studies in psychosomatic medicine are characterized by analyses that typically compare groups. This nomothetic approach leads to conclusions that apply to the average group member but not necessarily to individual patients. Idiographic studies start at the individual patient and are suitable to study associations that differ between time points or between individuals. We illustrate the advantages of the idiographic approach in analyzing ambulatory assessments, taking the association between depression and physical activity after myocardial infarction as an example.         Methods~         Five middle-aged men who had myocardial infarction with mild to moderate symptoms of depression were included in this study. Four of these participants monitored their physical activity and depressive symptoms during a period of 2 to 3 months using a daily self-registration form. The time series of each individual participant were investigated using vector autoregressive modeling, which enables the analysis of temporal dynamics between physical activity and depression.         Results~         We found causal heterogeneity in the association between depression and physical activity. Participants differed in the predominant direction of effect, which was either from physical activity to depression (n = 1, 85 observations, unstandardized effect size = −0.183, p = .03) or from depression to physical activity (n = 2, 65 and 59 observations, unstandardized effect sizes = −0.038 and −0.381, p {$<$} .001 and p = .04). Also, the persistency of effects differed among individuals.         Conclusions~         Vector autoregressive models are suitable in revealing causal heterogeneity and can be easily used to analyze ambulatory assessments. We suggest that these models might bridge the gap between science and clinical practice by translating epidemiological results to individual patients.

Although a great amount of research has gone into establishing convergence criteria and stopping rules with sound theoretical foundation, in practice, MCMC users often decide convergence by applying empirical diagnostic tools. This review article discusses the most widely used MCMC convergence diagnostic tools. Some recently proposed stopping rules with firm theoretical footing are also presented.

  abstract = {Understanding which factors influence dietary intake, particularly in daily life, is crucial given the impact diet has on physical as well as mental health. However, a factor might influence whether but not how much an individual eats and vice versa or a factor’s importance may differ across these two facets. Distinguishing between these two facets, hence, studying dietary intake as a dual process is conceptually promising and not only allows further insights, but also solves a statistical issue. When assessing the association between a predictor (e.g. momentary affect) and subsequent dietary intake in daily life through ecological momentary assessment (EMA), the outcome variable (e.g. energy intake within a predefined time-interval) is semicontinuous. That is, one part is equal to zero (i.e. no dietary intake occurred) and the other contains right-skewed positive values (i.e. dietary intake occurred, but often only small amounts are consumed). However, linear multilevel modelling which is commonly used for EMA data to account for repeated measures within individuals cannot be applied to semicontinuous outcomes. A highly informative statistical approach for semicontinuous outcomes is multilevel two-part modelling which treats the outcome as generated by a dual process, combining a multilevel logistic/probit regression for zeros and a multilevel (generalized) linear regression for nonzero values.},

  abstract = {Statistical network models based on Pairwise Markov Random Fields (PMRFs) have become increasingly popular tools to analyze multivariate psychological data, in large part due to their perceived role in generating insights into causal relationships between pairs of variables. This means that in practice statistical network models are used in analogous way to causal discovery methods from the causal modeling literature. However, it is clear that in the applied literature, the role of statistical networks in causal discovery is poorly understood. In this paper we provide a treatment of how PMRFs in general, and specifically the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) for normally distributed variables, operate as causal discovery tools. Using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and linear structural equation models (SEMs) as representations of causal structure, we outline the key assumptions are necessary for network-based causal discovery and characterize the equivalence classes of causal models that networks identify from data under those assumptions. This allows us to clarify a number of misconceptions which we have identified in the empirical literature around the interpretation of network models. These include: the interpretation of networks as causal skeletons, the ability of networks to identify chains of causal relationships, the role of collider variables and the bias they induce, and the use of networks for learning cyclic causal models.},

  abstract = {Most theories of emotion suggest that emotions are reactions to situations we encounter in daily life. Process theories of emotion further specify a feedback loop between our environment, attention, emotions, and action that clarifies the adaptive nature of emotions. In principle, such process theories describe how emotions develop in daily life, and consequently, emotion measures collected from individuals many times a day in studies using the Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) should be highly useful in developing these theories. However, current emotion theories are predominantly verbal theories and therefore do not make clear predictions in such data. In this paper, we take a first step towards a generative model of emotion dynamics by formalizing the link between situations and emotions, which provides us with a basic generative model of emotions in daily life. We show that this incomplete model already reproduces nine stable phenomena in emotion time series related to (temporal) associations between emotions and their distributional form. We then discuss how we can draw on existing (process) theories of emotion to extend our basic model into a complete generative model of emotion dynamics. Finally, we discuss how generative models of emotion dynamics can facilitate theory development and advance measurement, study design, and statistical analysis.},

We propose that computational models can be used to provide new insights into how treatments work and how they can be improved. We argue that treatments are best understood as interventions on systems of interacting components, and that computational models are needed if we are to accurately and precisely determine the effect an intervention will have on this system. We demonstrate this approach by using a computational model of panic disorder to conduct an in silico dismantling study of cognitive behavioral therapy. This simulated trial allows us to: identify a common source of treatment failure; propose a revised treatment protocol that mitigates this source of failure; and demonstrate that, if the model is accurate, this revised protocol will lead to improved treatment outcomes for 10\% of patients. We conclude with a discussion of the promise and challenges of using computational models for treatment research.},

  abstract = {Time series analysis is increasingly popular across scientific domains. A key concept in time series analysis is stationarity, the stability of statistical properties of a time series.  Understanding stationarity is crucial to addressing frequent issues in time series analysis such as the consequences of failing to model non-stationarity, how to determine the mechanisms generating non-stationarity, and consequently how to model those mechanisms (i.e. by differencing or detrending). However, many empirical researchers have limited understanding of stationarity, which can lead to the use of incorrect research practices and misleading substantive conclusions. In this paper, we address this problem by answering these questions in an accessible a way. To this end, we study how researchers can use detrending and differencing to model trends in time series analysis. We show via simulation the consequences of modeling trends inappropriately, and evaluate the performance of one popular approach to distinguish different trend types in empirical data. We present these results in an accessible way, providing an extensive introduction to key concepts in time series analysis, illustrated throughout with simple examples. Finally, we discuss a number of take-home messages and extensions to standard approaches, which directly address more complex time-series analysis problems encountered by empirical researchers.},

First, the negative side is construed as the negative side effects of positive psychology’s dominant, separatist message. Second, the negative side is construed as the negativity that can be found within the positive psychology movement. Here the author elaborates on the negative or dismissive reactions of some spokespersons for the movement to ideas or views that run counter to the movement’s dominant message: (a) negativity about negativity itself, which is explored by way of research in health psychology and coping styles; and (b) negativity about the wrong kind of positivity, namely, allegedly unscientific positivity, especially that which Seligman purports to find within humanistic psychology. This constitutes an epistemological position that contributes to “reality problems” for positive psychologists. The author concludes with the implications of positive psychology’s “Declaration of Independence” for psychology’s much discussed fragmentation woes. She appeals to the wisdom of William James for guidance in finding a third, more positive meaning of positive psychology’s negative side. This third meaning can be gleaned from a not-yet-dominant but more integrative message emerging within the movement, one compatible with the reactions of some humanistic psychologists to positive psychology.}

However, when applied to hierarchical (e.g., longitudinal or clustered) data, the predictive performance of gradient tree boosting may be harmed by ignoring the hierarchical structure, and may be improved by accounting for it. Tree-based methods such as regression trees and random forests have already been extended to hierarchical data settings by combining them with the linear mixed effects model (MEM). In the present article, we add to this literature by proposing two algorithms to estimate a combination of the MEM and gradient tree boosting. We report on two simulation studies that (i) investigate the predictive performance of the two MEM boosting algorithms and (ii) compare them to standard gradient tree boosting, standard random forest, and other existing methods for hierarchical data (MEM, MEM random forests, model-based boosting, Bayesian additive regression trees [BART]). We found substantial improvements in the predictive performance of our MEM boosting algorithms over standard boosting when the random effects were non-negligible. MEM boosting as well as BART showed a predictive performance similar to the correctly specified MEM (i.e., the benchmark model), and overall outperformed the model-based boosting and random forest approaches.},

  abstract = {Background Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders globally and has implications for various aspects of everyday-life. To date, studies assessing the association between social relationships and depression have provided conflicting results. The aim of this paper was to review the evidence on associations between social relationships and depression in the general population. Methods Studies investigating the association of social support, social networks, or social connectedness with depression were retrieved and summarized (searches using Pubmed, ScienceDirect, PsycNet were conducted in May 2014). Results Fifty-one studies were included in this review. The strongest and most consistent findings were significant protective effects of perceived emotional support, perceived instrumental support, and large, diverse social networks. Little evidence was found on whether social connectedness is related to depression, as was also the case for negative interactions. Limitations Due to the strict inclusion criteria relating to study quality and the availability of papers in the domain of interest, the review did not capture ‘gray literature’ and qualitative studies. Conclusion Future research is warranted to account for potential bias introduced by the use of subjective measures as compared to objective measures of received support and actual networks. Due to the heterogeneity between available studies on the measure of social relationships, the inclusion of comparable measures across studies would allow for more valid comparisons. In addition, well-designed prospective studies will provide more insight into causality. Future research should address how social support and networks interact and together affect risks for depression. Social connectedness and negative interactions appear to be underutilized as measures in population-based studies.},

Sleep-related activity was measured using 24-h wrist actigraphy over a 7-day period at home, during which participants also kept a sleep diary. High stress load in childhood, but not in adolescence, was associated with shortened actigraphically assessed total sleep time, prolonged sleep onset latency, decreased sleep efficiency and an increased number of body movements in sleep, even after accounting for the effects of later occurring stress and psychopathological symptoms such as depression and anxiety scores. Unexpectedly, no significant associations between early-life stress load and subjective sleep measures were found. Results are consistent with findings from previous studies indicating an association between childhood adversities and higher levels of nocturnal activity. The findings suggest that high stress load during childhood might be a vulnerability factor for sleep continuity problems in adulthood. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We here validate abnormal expression of inflammation-related genes in monocytes of a large and well-characterised group of MDD patients, and relate the outcomes to pertinent clinical characteristics. Thirty-two genes of a previously established inflammation-related gene signature were assessed in 197 patients with MDD, and 151 controls collected during the EU-MOODINFLAME project. Monocyte gene- expression data were related to age, sex, BMI, depression severity, childhood adversity (CA) and suicide risk (SR). Three distinct gene profiles were identified within the MDD group (downregulated, mixed upregulated and strongly upregulated genes). Patients in the merged upregulated groups had a significantly higher prevalence of CA and high SR. Using hierarchical clustering of the genes, we found a cluster of mainly cytokine (production)-related genes; patients with SR had a significantly higher expression of this cluster than patients without SR (particularly for IL-6, IL1A and IL1B). Such difference did not emerge for patients with and without CA. A downregulated gene profile was found for patients not exposed to CA and without SR (particularly for glucocorticoid-signalling genes NR3C1a and HSPA1/B). No inflammatory changes were observed for healthy controls exposed to CA. Our data show that inflammatory activation in MDD is not uniform, and that immunologically discernible phenotypes of depression can be linked to CA and high SR. The absence of monocyte inflammatory activation in healthy controls exposed to CA suggests an inflammatory involvement in MDD-prone individuals exposed to early stressors, but not healthy controls.},

  abstract = {BackgroundThere is increasing interest in day-to-day affect fluctuations of patients with depressive and anxiety disorders. Few studies have compared repeated assessments of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) across diagnostic groups, and fluctuation patterns were not uniformly defined. The aim of this study is to compare affect fluctuations in patients with a current episode of depressive or anxiety disorder, in remitted patients and in controls, using affect instability as a core concept but also describing other measures of variability and adjusting for possible confounders.MethodsEcological momentary assessment (EMA) data were obtained from 365 participants of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety with current (n = 95), remitted (n = 178) or no (n = 92) DSM-IV defined depression/anxiety disorder. For 2 weeks, five times per day, participants filled-out items on PA and NA. Affect instability was calculated as the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD). Tests on group differences in RMSSD, within-person variance, and autocorrelation were performed, controlling for mean affect levels.ResultsCurrent depression/anxiety patients had the highest affect instability in both PA and NA, followed by remitters and then controls. Instability differences between groups remained significant when controlling for mean affect levels, but differences between current and remitted were no longer significant.ConclusionsPatients with a current disorder have higher instability of NA and PA than remitted patients and controls. Especially with regard to NA, this could be interpreted as patients with a current disorder being more sensitive to internal and external stressors and having suboptimal affect regulation.},

  abstract = {Background: Relations among psychological variables are assumed to be complex and to vary over time. Personalized networks can model multivariate complex interactions. The development of time-varying networks allows to model the variation of parameters over time. Objectives: We aimed to determine the value of time-varying networks for clinical practice. Methods: We applied time-varying mixed graphical models (TV-MGM) and time-varying vector autoregressive models (TV-VAR) to intensive longitudinal data of nine participants with depressive symptoms (n = 6) or anxiety (n = 3). Results: Most of the participants showed temporal changes in network topology within the assessment period of 30 days. Time-varying networks of participants with small, medium, and large time variability in edge parameters clearly show the different temporal evolvements of dynamic interactions between variables. The case example indicates clinical utility but also limitations to the application of time-varying networks in clinical practice. Conclusion: Time-varying network models provide a data-driven and exploratory approach that could complement current diagnostic standards by reflecting interacting, often mutually reinforcing processes of mental health problems and by accounting for variation over time. They can be used to generate hypotheses for further confirmatory and clinical testing.},

  abstract = {The investigation of within-person process models, often done in experience sampling designs, requires a reliable assessment of within-person change. In this paper, we focus on dyadic intensive longitudinal designs where both partners of a couple are assessed multiple times each day across several days. We introduce a statistical model for variance decomposition based on generalizability theory (extending P. E. Shrout \& S. P. Lane, ), which can estimate the relative proportion of variability on four hierarchical levels: moments within a day, days, persons, and couples. Based on these variance estimates, four reliability coefficients are derived: between-couples, between-persons, within-persons/between-days, and within-persons/between-moments. We apply the model to two dyadic intensive experience sampling studies (n1 =\,130 persons, 5 surveys each day for 14 days, ≥\,7508 unique surveys; n2 =\,508 persons, 5 surveys each day for 28 days, ≥\,47764 unique surveys). Five different scales in the domain of motivational processes and relationship quality were assessed with 2 to 5 items: State relationship satisfaction, communal motivation, and agentic motivation; the latter consists of two subscales, namely power and independence motivation. Largest variance components were on the level of persons, moments, couples, and days, where within-day variance was generally larger than between-day variance. Reliabilities ranged from .32 to .76 (couple level), .93 to .98 (person level), .61 to .88 (day level), and .28 to .72 (moment level). Scale intercorrelations reveal differential structures between and within persons, which has consequences for theory building and statistical modeling.},

  abstract = {Epistemic trust (ET) describes the willingness to accept new information from another person as trustworthy, generalizable, and relevant. It has been recently proposed that a pervasive failure to establish epistemic trust may underpin personality disorders. Although the introduction of the concept of ET has been inspiring to clinicians and is already impacting the field, the idea that there may be individual differences in ET has yet to be operationalized and tested empirically. This report illustrates the development of an Epistemic trust assessment and describes the protocol for its validation. The sample will include 60 university students. The Trier Social Stress Test for Groups will be administered to induce a state of uncertainty and stress, thereby increasing the relevance of information for the participants. The experiment will entail asking information from the participants about their performance and internal states during a simulated employment interview, and then tracking how participants are able to revise their own judgments about themselves in light of the feedback coming from an expert committee. To control for social desirability and personality disorder traits, the short scale for social desirability (Kurzskala Soziale Erwünschtheit-Gamma) and the Inventory of Personality Organization are utilized. After the procedure, the participants will complete an app-based Epistemic trust questionnaire (ETQ) app. Confirmatory Factor Analysis will be utilized to investigate the structure and dimensionality of the ETQ, and ANOVAs will be used to investigate mean differences within and between persons for ET scores by item category. This study operationalizes a newly developed ET paradigm and provides a framework for the investigation of the theoretical assumptions about the connection of ET and personality functioning.},

Demographic and clinical data, data on physical activity and depression assessments, and odds ratios, relative risks, and hazard ratios with 95\% confidence intervals were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, and the potential sources of heterogeneity were explored. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Results:A total of 49 unique prospective studies (N=266,939; median proportion of males across studies, 47\%) were followed up for 1,837,794 person-years. Compared with people with low levels of physical activity, those with high levels had lower odds of developing depression (adjusted odds ratio=0.83, 95\% CI=0.79, 0.88; I2=0.00). Furthermore, physical activity had a protective effect against the emergence of depression in youths (adjusted odds ratio=0.90, 95\% CI=0.83, 0.98), in adults (adjusted odds ratio=0.78, 95\% CI=0.70, 0.87), and in elderly persons (adjusted odds ratio=0.79, 95\% CI=0.72, 0.86). Protective effects against depression were found across geographical regions, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 0.65 to 0.84 in Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania, and against increased incidence of positive screen for depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio=0.84, 95\% CI=0.79, 0.89) or major depression diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio=0.86, 95\% CI=0.75, 0.98). No moderators were identified. Results were consistent for unadjusted odds ratios and for adjusted and unadjusted relative risks/hazard ratios. Overall study quality was moderate to high (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score, 6.3). Although significant publication bias was found, adjusting for this did not change the magnitude of the associations.Conclusions:Available evidence supports the notion that physical activity can confer protection against the emergence of depression regardless of age and geographical region.},

Methods Electronic databases were searched from inception till 04/2016 for articles measuring PA and SB with a self-report questionnaire (SRQ) or objective measure (e.g. accelerometer) in people with MDD. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Results Twenty-four eligible studies were identified including 2901 people with MDD (78.4\% female, mean age=54 years; range: 21–77 years). People with MDD spent 126.0min (95\%CI=91.9–160.1) per day engaging in all types of PA and spent 8.5hours (95\%CI=7.51–9.62) during their waking day being sedentary. Compared to controls, people with MDD spent less time in total PA (SMD=−0.25, 95\%CI=−0.03 to 0.15) and moderate to vigorous PA (SMD=−0.30, 95\%CI=−0.40 to 0.21) and engaged in higher levels of SB (SMD=0.09, 95\%CI=0.01–0.18). The proportion of people with MDD not meeting the recommended PA guidelines was 67.8\% (n=13 studies), which was higher in studies relying on objective versus self-report measures (85.7\% v 62.1\%, p=0.04). People with MDD were less likely than controls to meet recommended PA guidelines (OR=−1.50, 95\%CI=−1.10 to −2.10). Limitations Heterogeneity was evident in most analyses. Conclusions Adults with MDD engage in low levels of PA and high levels of SB. PA and SB are independent predictors of mortality, therefore, future lifestyle interventions targeting both the prevention of SB and adoption and maintenance of PA are warranted.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess the extent to which specific hypotheses derived from the network theory regarding the (interindividual) changeability of symptom dynamics in response to treatment align with empirical data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This secondary analysis entails data from a multisite randomized clinical trial, in which 254 patients with chronic depression reported on their depressive symptoms at every treatment session. Data collection was conducted between March 5, 2010, and October 14, 2013, and this analysis was conducted between November 1, 2021, and May 31, 2022. INTERVENTION Thirty-two sessions of either disorder-specific or nonspecific psychotherapy for chronic depression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Longitudinal associations of depressive symptoms with each other and change of these associations through treatment estimated by a time-varying longitudinal network model. RESULTS In a sample of 254 participants (166 [65.4\%] women; mean [SD] age, 44.9 [11.9] years), symptom interactions changed through treatment, and this change varied across treatments and individuals. The mean absolute (ie, valence-ignorant) strength of symptom interactions (logarithmic odds ratio scale) increased from 0.40 (95\% CI, 0.36-0.44) to 0.60 (95\% CI, 0.52-0.70) during nonspecific psychotherapy and to 0.56 (95\% CI, 0.48-0.64) during disorder-specific psychotherapy. In contrast, the mean raw (ie, valence-sensitive) strength of symptom interactions decreased from 0.32 (95\% CI, 0.28-0.36) to 0.26 (95\% CI, 0.20-0.32) and to 0.09 (95\% CI, 0.02-0.16), respectively. Changing symptom severity could be explained to a large extent by symptom interactions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that specific treatment-related hypotheses of the network theory align well with empirical data. Conceptualizing mental disorders as symptom networks and treatments as measures that aim to change these networks is expected to give further insights into the working mechanisms of mental health treatments, leading to the improvement of current and the development of new treatments.},

  abstract = {Background: The network approach to psychopathology, which assesses associations between individual symptoms, has recently been applied to evaluate treatments for mental disorders. While various options for conducting a network analysis in intervention research exist, no structured guidelines have been established yet. To gain an overview and evaluate the potential of different analytic options, we conducted a systematic review on these studies. Methods: We systematically searched the literature with combining terms on network analysis, mental health problems, and intervention studies. Studies were included if they constructed a symptom network, analysed data that was collected before, during or after a treatment for mental disorders, and yielded information about the treatment effect. Information on sample characteristics, the intervention, the research design, the estimated networks, the statistical analyses, and open science practices were extracted. Results: Across the 56 included studies, network analyses varied widely. About half of the studies estimated cross-sectional networks without a treatment node, e.g., for different treatment groups separately or for a single group before, and after treatment. About 20\% of the studies analysed cross-sectional networks including a treatment node and a third of the studies estimated longitudinal networks. Studies differed on how networks were estimated, which network parameters were calculated, and which statistical tests were applied. Conclusion: This review highlighted that many different analytic options exist when applying the network approach to intervention research. As the potential of the network approach depends on the applied methodologies, the analytic choices need to be further investigated and structured guidelines need to be developed.},

Separate networks were constructed based on 1) empirical symptom data and 2) clinicians’ perceived symptom relations (PSR).Results: Both the network based on empirical data and the network based on clinicians’ PSR showed that symptoms of PTSD and depression related most strongly within each respective cluster (connected mainly via sleeping problems), externalizing symptoms were somewhat related to PTSD symptoms and intrusions were central. Some differences were found within the clinicians’ PSR as well as between the PSR and the empirical network. Still, the general PSR-network structure showed a moderate to good fit to the empirical data.Conclusion: Our results suggest that sleeping problems and intrusions play a central role in the symptomatology of refugee children, which has tentative implications for diagnostics and treatment. Further, externalizing symptoms might be an indicator for PTSD-symptoms. Finally, using clinicians’ PSR for network construction offered a promising possibility to gain information on symptom networks and their clinical validity.},

  abstract = {Background Web-based and blended (face-to-face plus Web-based) interventions for mental health disorders are gaining significance. However, many licensed psychotherapists still have guarded attitudes toward computer-assisted therapy, hindering dissemination efforts. Objective The objective of this study was to provide a therapist-oriented evaluation of Web-based and blended therapies and identify commonalities and differences in attitudes toward both formats. Furthermore, it aimed to test the impact of an information clip on expressed attitudes. Methods In total, 95 Austrian psychotherapists were contacted and surveyed via their listed occupational email address. An 8-minute information video was shown to half of the therapists before 19 advantages and 13 disadvantages had to be rated on a 6-point Likert scale. Results The sample resembled all assessed properties of Austrian psychotherapists (age, theoretical orientation, and region). Therapists did not hold a uniform overall preference. Instead, perceived advantages of both interventions were rated as neutral (t94=1.89, P=.06; d=0.11), whereas Web-based interventions were associated with more disadvantages and risks (t94=9.86, P{$<$}.001; d=0.81). The information clip did not excerpt any detectable effect on therapists’ attitudes (r95=−.109, P=.30). The application of modern technologies in the own therapeutic practice and cognitive behavioral orientation were positively related to the given ratings. Conclusions This study is the first to directly compare therapists’ attitudes toward Web-based and blended therapies. Positive attitudes play a pivotal role in the dissemination of new technologies, but unexperienced therapists seem to lack knowledge on how to benefit from technology-aided treatments. To speed up implementation, these aspects need to be addressed in the development of new interventions. Furthermore, the preference of blended treatments over Web-based interventions seems to relate to avoidance of risks. Although this study is likely to represent therapists’ attitudes in countries with less advanced electronic health services, therapists’ attitudes in more advanced countries might present differently.},

  abstract = {Therapists hold a key role for the uptake of digital mental health interventions (DMHI) within regular care services but have demonstrated cautious attitudes towards such interventions. It is relevant to explore in detail what factors may positively influence therapists' perception when considering DMHI implementation within routine care. We recently assessed therapist views towards Internet-based and blended treatment in Austria (low implementation level). The present study aims at testing the reliability of previous findings, and moreover, it compares therapists' appraisals to a country with advanced DMHI implementation (Sweden). An online survey was conducted February through June of 2019. Respondents were recruited via email and social media. The survey assessed first-hand experience with Internet-based treatment (IT) and blended treatment (BT). To start, the survey presented a short informational video to half of the respondents, then assessed therapists' views on 17 advantages and 13 disadvantages of IT and BT on 6-point Likert scales. In total N~=~300 therapists responded to the invitation, of which N~=~165 provided full survey data (Germany 114/220, 52\%; Sweden 51/80, 64\%). German therapists rated the advantages of IT and BT as neutral (IT, M~=~3.6; BT, M~=~3.8) and to some extent agreed with disadvantages of IT (IT, M~=~4.5; BT, M~=~3.5). In comparison, Swedish therapists rated significantly greater advantages (IT, M~=~4.6; BT, M~=~4.5) and less disadvantages (IT, M~=~3.2; BT, M~=~2.8). Effect sizes ranged from d~=~0.89 to d~=~1.83; all P's~{$<~$}.001. Those with first-hand experience with DMHI reported more positive appraisals in both countries. No significant effect was found for exposure to the short informational video. The German sample represented essential characteristics of current German therapists; in comparison Swedish respondents skewed towards younger less experienced therapists (P's~{$<~$}.001). Those confounders accounted for a small non-significant proportion of variance (0.1–4.7\%). We found that therapists considered blended treatment to have less disadvantages than Internet treatment, and that first-hand experience with DMHI, but not exposure to an acceptance facilitating video clip, predicted greater acceptability on individual level. The responses among German therapists closely resembled findings from our preceding study in Austria, indicating that reliable results can be achieved in small survey studies if sample and population parameters correspond. Swedish therapists held significantly more favorable attitudes towards both interventions. The comparison between countries, however, is limited by a number of potential confounding variables.},

  abstract = {Multilevel autoregressive models are especially suited for modeling between-person differences in within-person processes. Fitting these models with Bayesian techniques requires the specification of prior distributions for all parameters. Often it is desirable to specify prior distributions that have negligible effects on the resulting parameter estimates. However, the conjugate prior distribution for covariance matrices—the Inverse-Wishart distribution—tends to be informative when variances are close to zero. This is problematic for multilevel autoregressive models, because autoregressive parameters are usually small for each individual, so that the variance of these parameters will be small. We performed a simulation study to compare the performance of three Inverse-Wishart prior specifications suggested in the literature, when one or more variances for the random effects in the multilevel autoregressive model are small. Our results show that the prior specification that uses plug-in ML estimates of the variances performs best. We advise to always include a sensitivity analysis for the prior specification for covariance matrices of random parameters, especially in autoregressive models, and to include a data-based prior specification in this analysis. We illustrate such an analysis by means of an empirical application on repeated measures data on worrying and positive affect.},

  abstract = {Measurement error is omnipresent in psychological data. However, the vast majority of applications of autoregressive time series analyses in psychology do not take measurement error into account. Disregarding measurement error when it is present in the data results in a bias of the autoregressive parameters. We discuss two models that take measurement error into account: An autoregressive model with a white noise term (AR+WN), and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. In a simulation study we compare the parameter recovery performance of these models, and compare this performance for both a Bayesian and frequentist approach. We find that overall, the AR+WN model performs better. Furthermore, we find that for realistic (i.e., small) sample sizes, psychological research would benefit from a Bayesian approach in fitting these models. Finally, we illustrate the effect of disregarding measurement error in an AR(1) model by means of an empirical application on mood data in women. We find that, depending on the person, approximately 30–50\% of the total variance was due to measurement error, and that disregarding this measurement error results in a substantial underestimation of the autoregressive parameters.},

Especially in complex statistical analyses—such as the analysis of longitudinal data—reproducing results is far from simple, especially if no source code is available. In this work we aimed to reproduce analyses of longitudinal data of 11 articles published in PLOS ONE. Inclusion criteria were the availability of data and author consent. We investigated the types of methods and software used and whether we were able to reproduce the data analysis using open source software. Most articles provided overview tables and simple visualisations. Generalised Estimating Equations (GEEs) were the most popular statistical models among the selected articles. Only one article used open source software and only one published part of the analysis code. Replication was difficult in most cases and required reverse engineering of results or contacting the authors. For three articles we were not able to reproduce the results, for another two only parts of them. For all but two articles we had to contact the authors to be able to reproduce the results. Our main learning is that reproducing papers is difficult if no code is supplied and leads to a high burden for those conducting the reproductions. Open data policies in journals are good, but to truly boost reproducibility we suggest adding open code policies.},

An important task in their analysis is determining which variables are unrelated in the network, i.e., are independent given the rest of the network variables. This conditional independence structure is a gateway to understanding the causal structure underlying psychological processes. Thus, it is crucial to have an appropriate method for evaluating conditional independence and dependence hypotheses. Bayesian approaches to testing such hypotheses allow researchers to differentiate between absence of evidence and evidence of absence of connections (edges) between pairs of variables in a network. Three Bayesian approaches to assessing conditional independence have been proposed in the network psychometrics literature. We believe that their theoretical foundations are not widely known, and therefore we provide a conceptual review of the proposed methods and highlight their strengths and limitations through a small-scale simulation study. Finally, we provide recommendations on how to choose the optimal method and discuss the current gaps in the literature on this important topic.},

The study population consisted of 77 preadolescents referred to counseling services in their schools in Israel. They were treated in 11 small counseling groups led by novice counselors. Variables included self-disclosure, client behavior in therapy, and responsiveness to other group members--all assessed based on transcribed sessions. Participants also completed attachment questionnaires. The analyses were performed with hierarchical modeling (mixed) nesting individuals within groups. Results indicated differences on all dependent variables among the three attachment styles: secure, preoccupied, and avoidant. Secure adolescents showed the highest rates of self-disclosure, productive client behavior, and responsiveness to others, whereas avoidant participants showed the lowest scores on all measures. Gender, age, and group size showed little effect. The discussion focuses on implications for group therapists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

This study investigates the performance of standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) and comparative fit index (CFI) in small df models with various levels of factor loadings, sample sizes, and model misspecifications. We find that, in comparison with RMSEA, population SRMR and CFI are less susceptible to the effects of df. In small df models, the sample SRMR and CFI could provide more useful information to differentiate models with various levels of misfit. The confidence intervals and p-values of a close fit were generally accurate for all three fit indices. We recommend researchers use caution when interpreting RMSEA for models with small df and to rely more on SRMR and CFI.},

  abstract = {Assessment in clinical psychology typically relies on global retrospective self-reports collected at research or clinic visits, which are limited by recall bias and are not well suited to address how behavior changes over time and across contexts. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects’ current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects’ natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects’ lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

When these states have been studied over time, researchers have often observed an unpredicted and puzzling decrease with repeated assessment. When noted, this pattern has been called an “attenuation effect,” suggesting that the effect is due to bias in later reports. However, the pattern could also be consistent with an initial elevation bias. We present systematic, experimental investigations of this effect in four field studies (study 1: n = 870; study 2: n = 246; study 3: n = 870; study 4: n = 141). Findings show clear support for an initial elevation bias rather than a later decline. This bias is larger for reports of internal states than for behaviors and for negative mental states and physical symptoms than for positive states. We encourage increased awareness and investigation of this initial elevation bias in all research using subjective reports.},

  abstract = {Idiographic network models are estimated on time-series data of a single individual and allow researchers to investigate person-specific associations between multiple variables over time. The most common approach for fitting such graphical vector autoregressive (gVAR) models uses LASSO regularization to estimate a contemporaneous network and a temporal network. However, estimation of idiographic networks can be unstable in relatively small data sets typical for psychological research. This bears the risk of misinterpreting differences in estimated networks as spurious heterogeneity between individuals. As a remedy, we evaluate the performance of a Bayesian alternative for fitting gVAR models that allows for regularization of parameters while accounting for estimation uncertainty. We first compare Bayesian and LASSO approaches across a range of conditions and performance measures in a simulation study. Overall, LASSO estimation performed well, while Bayesian gVAR may perform better when the true network is dense. We also develop a novel test, implemented in the tsnet package in R, which assesses whether differences between estimated networks are reliable based on matrix norms. In a simulation study, the test was conservative and showed good false-positive rates. Finally, we apply Bayesian estimation and the novel testing approach in an empirical example using daily data on clinical symptoms for 40 individuals. Overall, Bayesian gVAR modeling facilitates the assessment of estimation uncertainty which is important for studying inter-individual differences of intra-individual dynamics.},

  abstract = {Simulation studies are widely used for evaluating the performance of statistical methods in psychology. However, the quality of simulation studies can vary widely in terms of their design, execution, and reporting. In order to assess the quality of typical simulation studies in psychology, we reviewed 321 articles published in Psychological Methods, Behavioral Research Methods, and Multivariate Behavioral Research in 2021 and 2022, among which 100/321 = 31.2\% report a simulation study. We find that many articles do not provide complete and transparent information about key aspects of the study, such as justifications for the number of simulation repetitions, Monte Carlo uncertainty estimates, or code and data to reproduce the simulation studies. To address this problem, we provide a summary of the ADEMP (Aims, Data-generating mechanism, Estimands and other targets, Methods, Performance measures) design and reporting framework from Morris, White, and Crowther (2019) adapted to simulation studies in psychology. Based on this framework, we provide ADEMP-PreReg, a step-by-step template for researchers to use when designing, potentially preregistering, and reporting their simulation studies. We give formulae for estimating common performance measures, their Monte Carlo standard errors, and for calculating the number of simulation repetitions to achieve a desired Monte Carlo standard error. Finally, we give a detailed tutorial on how to apply the ADEMP framework in practice using an example simulation study on the evaluation of methods for the analysis of pre–post measurement experiments.},

  abstract = {Background: As phenotypes of depressive disorders (DD) are highly heterogenous, a growing number of studies investigate person-specific associations of depressive symptoms in time series data. Most available methods for estimating applicable models rely on the assumption that the associations between variables stay constant over time, which can be unrealistic in clinical contexts. To circumvent this limitation, we used a recently developed technique to estimate time-varying vector autoregressive models. Methods: In daily diary data of 20 participants with DD with a mean length of 274 days (SD = 82.4, range = 154-539), we modeled idiographic associations between core depressive symptoms, rumination, sleep, and quantity and quality of social contacts as idiographic time-varying dynamical networks. Results: Resulting models showed marked inter- as well as intraindividual differences. For some participants, associations between variables changed fast over time, whereas for others they showed more stability. Our results further indicated nonstationarity in all time series. Discussion: Idiographic symptom networks of depression can be of interest to clinicians and researchers as they can capture changes over time and provide detailed insights into the temporal course of mental disorders. Whilst the assumption of stationarity can hinder insights into important change processes, time-varying network models are a promising approach. We discuss limitations, their possible solutions, and recommendations for further use of the modeling technique.},

The former is advantageous for prediction accuracy and for avoiding model misspecifications. The latter is important for efficient learning of the fixed effects predictor function and for obtaining probabilistic predictions. Our proposed algorithm is also a novel solution for handling high-cardinality categorical variables in tree-boosting. In addition, we present an extension that scales to large data using a Vecchia approximation for the Gaussian process model relying on novel results for covariance parameter inference.

The models differ in approach (e.g. deterministic or agent-based) and in assumptions made about the disease and population. These differences capture genuine uncertainty in the understanding of disease dynamics and in the choice of simplifying assumptions underpinning the model. Although analyses of multi-model ensembles can be logistically challenging when time-frames are short, accounting for structural uncertainty can improve accuracy and reduce the risk of over-confidence in predictions.

The commonly adopted Bayesian setup involves the conjugate prior, multivariate normal distribution for the regression coefficients and inverse Wishart specification for the covariance matrix. Here we depart from this approach and propose a novel Bayesian estimator for the covariance. A multivariate normal prior for the unique elements of the matrix logarithm of the covariance matrix is considered. Such structure allows for a richer class of prior distributions for the covariance, with respect to strength of beliefs in prior location hyperparameters, as well as the added ability, to model potential correlation amongst the covariance structure. The posterior moments of all relevant parameters of interest are calculated based upon numerical results via a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. The Metropolis-Hastings-within-Gibbs algorithm is invoked to account for the construction of a proposal density that closely matches the shape of the target posterior distribution. As an application of the proposed technique, we investigate a multiple regression based upon the 1980 High School and Beyond Survey.},

A parent's capacity to understand the nature and function of her own as well as her child's mental states, thus allowing her to create both a physical and psychological experience of comfort and safety for her child, is proposed. In this study of 40 mothers and their babies, maternal reflective functioning is measured using the Parent Development Interview (PDI; Aber, Slade, Berger, Bresgi, \& Kaplan, 1985), and scored for reflective functioning using an addendum to Fonagy, Target, Steele, \& Steele's (1998) reflective functioning scoring manual (Slade, Bernbach, Grienenberger, Levy, \& Locker, 2004). The relations between maternal reflective functioning and both adult (measured in pregnancy) and infant attachment (measured at 14 months) are examined. The findings indicate that relations between adult attachment and parental reflective functioning are significant, as are relations between parental reflective functioning and infant attachment. A preliminary mediation analysis suggests that parental reflective functioning plays a crucial role in the intergenerational transmission of attachment.}

This paper introduces the construct of parental reflective functioning, which refers to the parent’s capacity to hold the child’s mental states in mind, and begins with a review of Fonagy and his colleagues’ essential ideas regarding the reflective function. Next, the applicability of this construct to parental representations of the child and the parent – child relationship is considered.

This cluster randomized trial examined the outcomes for 88 mothers and babies participating in the New Beginnings program and 75 dyads residing in prisons where the intervention did not take place. Outcomes were measured in terms of parental reflective functioning, the quality of parent–infant interaction, maternal depression, and maternal representations. Mothers in the control group deteriorated in their level of reflective functioning and behavioral interaction with their babies over time, whereas the mothers in the intervention group did not. There were no significant group effects on levels of maternal depression or mothers’ self-reported representations of their babies over time. An attachment-based intervention may mitigate some of the risks to the quality of the parent–infant relationship for these dyads.},

Here, we present the state-space modeling framework with recommendations for the considerations that go into modeling EMA data. These recommendations can account for the issues that come up in EMA data analysis such as idiographic versus nomothetic modeling, missing data, and stationary versus non-stationary data. In addition, we suggest R packages in order to implement these recommendations in practice. Overall, well-designed EMA studies offer opportunities for researchers to handle the momentary minutiae in their assessment of psychological phenomena.},

  abstract = {Objective:Disruptions in biological rhythms and sleep are a core aspect of mood disorders, with sleep and rhythm changes frequently occurring prior to and during mood episodes. Wrist-worn actigraphs are increasingly utilized to measure ambulatory activity rhythm and sleep patterns.Methods:A comprehensive study using subjective and objective measures of sleep and biological rhythms was conducted in 111 participants (40 healthy volunteers [HC], 38 with major depressive disorder [MDD] and 33 with bipolar disorder [BD]). Participants completed 15-day actigraphy and first-morning urine samples to measure 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels. Sleep and biological rhythm questionnaires were administered: Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN), Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Actigraph data were analyzed for sleep and daily activity rhythms, light exposure and likelihood of transitioning between rest and activity states.Results:Mood groups had worse subjective sleep quality (PSQI) and biological rhythm disruption (BRIAN) and higher objective mean nighttime activity than controls. Participants with BD had longer total sleep time, higher circadian quotient and lower 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels than HC group. The MDD group had longer sleep onset latency and higher daytime probability of transitioning from rest to activity than HCs. Mood groups displayed later mean timing of light exposure. Multiple linear regression analysis with BRIAN scores, circadian quotient, mean nighttime activity during rest and daytime probability of transitioning from activity to rest explained 43\% of variance in quality-of-life scores. BRIAN scores, total sleep time and probability of transitioning from activity to rest explained 52\% of variance in functioning (all p {$<$} 0.05).Conclusions:Disruption in biological rhythms is associated with poorer functioning and quality of life in bipolar and MDD. Investigating biological rhythms and sleep using actigraphy variables, urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and subjective measures provide evidence of widespread sleep and circadian system disruptions in mood disorders.},

Two common measures of the uncertainty inherent in a distribution of possible outcomes are variance and entropy, yet there is currently no standard for when one measure should be used over the other. This paper explores this question using two models of resource uncertainty. For small numbers of discrete possible outcomes, variance is the better measure because it captures the spread between outcomes as well as their differential possibilities. However, variance can categorically fail as a measure of uncertainty when distributions are multimodal or discontinuous, in which case entropy should be used to characterize uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Background Physical inactivity and depressive symptoms following cardiothoracic transplantation are recognized as potentially modifiable psychosocial factors to improve clinical outcomes. However, few studies have prospectively assessed these in ambulatory, outpatient transplant recipients. Methods We conducted a prospective, single-center study examining actigraphy-assessed physical activity (PA) levels over a 1-week period in heart or lung transplant recipients recruited at 6 months (range 4-9) post-transplant. Depressive symptoms (Centers for Epidemiologic Study of Depression [CESD]), quality of life (QoL), and clinical events (transplant-related hospitalization and death) were collected. Clustered Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations between PA, psychological measures, and clinical events. Results Among 105 potentially eligible participants, 66 (63\%) met inclusion criteria and were enrolled between July, 2016 and May, 2017, including 42 lung and 24 heart transplant recipients. The mean age of the population was 53 years, 41\% were women and 18\% were black. Participants tended to be sedentary, with the majority of activity spent within the “sedentary” level (61\%) and an average daily step count of 7188 (SD = 2595). In addition, participants tended to exhibit subclinical depressive symptoms, (mean CESD = 9.4 [SD = 8]) with only a subset exhibiting levels suggestive of clinical depression (22\%). Over a median follow-up of 1.4 years (1.14, 1.62), 21 participants (32\%) experienced at least one transplant-related hospitalization, including two deaths. In adjusted survival models, greater intensity of PA (HR = 0.45 [0.24, 0.84] per 0.2 METs, P = .012) was associated with a lower risk of clinical events, whereas greater depressive symptoms (HR = 2.11 [1.58, 2.82] per 9 CESD points, P {$<$} .001) at 6 months were associated a higher likelihood of subsequent transplant-related hospitalization and/or death. Conclusions Physical inactivity and depressive symptoms at 6 months post-transplant were predictive of subsequent adverse clinical events among ambulatory cardiothoracic transplant recipients. Future studies should examine whether improving these potentially modifiable post-transplant risk factors improves clinical outcomes.},

Everyday life experience sampling, during which participants respond to “probes” delivered at random intervals throughout the day on their mobile devices, is an effective tool for capturing such diurnal fluctuations in a naturalistic way. The existence of diurnal fluctuations in the case of mind-wandering, however, has not been examined to date. We did so in two studies. In the first study, we employed everyday experience sampling to obtain self-reports from 146 university students who rated the degree of free movement in their thoughts multiple times per day over five days. These time course data were analyzed using multilevel modelling. Freely moving thought was found to fluctuate reliably over the course of the day, with lower ratings reported in the early morning and afternoon and higher ratings around midday and evening. In the second study, we replicated these effects with a reanalysis of data from a past everyday experience-sampling study. We also demonstrated differences in parameter values for the models representing freely moving thought and two common conceptualizations of mind-wandering: task-unrelated thought and stimulus-independent thought. Taken together, the present results establish and replicate a complex pattern of change over the course of the day in how freely thought moves, while also providing further evidence that freedom of movement is dissociable from other dimensions of thought such as its task-relatedness and stimulus-dependence. Future research should focus on probing possible mechanisms behind circadian fluctuations of thought dynamics.},

Second, we examined the effects of the ESM self-monitoring intervention on these daily life behaviors. Methods: Individuals with a diagnosis of depression (N = 102) receiving pharmacological treatment were randomized to 1 of 2 six-week ESM intervention conditions or a control condition. Physical, sedentary, social, and leisure behaviors as well as depressive symptoms were assessed prospectively in every-day life at baseline, postintervention, and during the ESM interventions. Results: Change in physical activity and talking from baseline to postintervention was associated with change in depressive symptoms from baseline to postintervention. Within-person daily fluctuations in talking, physical activity, doing nothing/resting, and being alone predicted end-of-day depressive symptoms over and above depressive symptoms at the previous day. The ESM interventions contributed to change in talking, doing nothing/resting, and being alone over time in comparison with the control group. The analyses revealed individual differences in the amount of behavioral change over time and in the within-subject associations between daily behaviors and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The findings suggest that physical, sedentary, and social behaviors have affective implications for daily mental health of individuals with depression. Self-monitoring using ESM may be a useful add-on tool to achieve behavioral change and to gain personalized insight in behaviors that improve daily depressive symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record},

  abstract = {Objective~         Longitudinal data allow for conclusions about the temporal order of events and interactional dynamics between several processes. The aim of this article is to provide a concise and pragmatic description of time series analyses (TSAs) of patient samples with numerous (or daily) repeated biological, behavioral, or psychological measurements. In addition, the article demonstrates how to implement the described analyses with the software R.         Methods~         To illustrate the concrete application of the time series method, we use two case series of patients with anorexia nervosa. Upon awakening, the patients collected salivary cortisol on a daily basis and answered several questions on a handheld computer (electronic diary) regarding psychosocial variables at the time of salivary collection.         Results~         Basic concepts of time series analysis such as stationarity, auto- and cross-correlation, Granger causality, impulse response function, and variance decomposition are presented. In addition, we demonstrate vector autoregressive analyses with three variables. For Patient 1, we demonstrate how TSA is used to detect cortisol and anxiety decreases during inpatient treatment and also how TSA can be used to show that an increase in cortisol is followed by a next-day increase in anxiety. For Patient 2, TSA was used to show higher salivary cortisol upon awakening on the days the patient was weighed compared with other days. In addition, we show how interdependencies of depressive feelings, positive anticipations, and cortisol values can be quantified using TSA.         Conclusions~         Time series designs enable modeling of temporal relationships and bidirectional associations between biopsychosocial variables within individuals. These individual patterns cannot be derived from traditional group-based statistical analyses. This article provides accessible research tools for conducting TSA relevant to psychosomatic and biobehavioral research.},

  abstract = {Understanding of interactional dynamics between several processes is one of the most important challenges in psychology and psychosomatic medicine. Researchers exploring behavior or other psychological phenomena mostly deal with ordinal or interval data. Missing values and consequential non-equidistant measurements represent a general problem of longitudinal studies from this field. The majority of process-oriented methodologies was originally designed for equidistant data measured on ratio scales. Therefore, the goal of this article is to clarify the conditions for satisfactory performance of longitudinal methods with data typical in psychological and psychosomatic research. This study examines the performance of the Johansen test, a procedure incorporating a set of sophisticated time series techniques, in reference to data quality utilizing a Monte Carlo method. The main results of the conducted simulation studies are: (1) Time series analyses require samples of at least 70 observations for an accurate estimation and inference. (2) Discrete data and failing equidistance of measurements due to irregular missing values appear unproblematic. (3) Relevant characteristics of stationary processes can be adequately captured using 5- or 7-point ordinal scales. (4) For trending processes, at least 10-point scales are necessary to ensure an acceptable quality of estimation and inference.},

This study examines the utility of shorter versions (PHQ-2, GAD-2, and K-6) as screening instruments and measures of treatment response. Method Data from research trial participants (n\,=\,993) receiving internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) were analysed to establish discriminant validity of the short versions.

Criterion group validity, test–retest reliability, internal consistency, and responsiveness to treatment changes were examined. Analyses were replicated using data from patients receiving iCBT in routine care (n\,=\,1389). Results Discriminant validity was excellent for the PHQ-2, and acceptable for the GAD-2 and K-6. Acceptable sensitivity and specificity were identified at a threshold of ≥3 for the PHQ-2 and GAD-2, and ≥14 for the K-6. The short versions were sensitive to treatment change.

It is unknown how this association generalizes to individuals. The aim of the present study was to investigate interindividual differences in the bidirectional dynamic relationship between physical activity and affect, in depressed and nondepressed individuals, using time-series analysis. Method: A pair-matched sample of 10 depressed and 10 nondepressed participants (mean age = 36.6, SD = 8.9, 30\% males) wore accelerometers and completed electronic questionnaires 3 times a day for 30 days. Physical activity was operationalized as the total energy expenditure (EE) per day segment (i.e., 6 hr). The multivariate time series (T = 90) of every individual were analyzed using vector autoregressive modeling (VAR), with the aim to assess direct as well as lagged (i.e., over 1 day) effects of EE on positive and negative affect, and vice versa. Results: Large interindividual differences in the strength, direction and temporal aspects of the relationship between physical activity and positive and negative affect were observed. An exception was the direct (but not the lagged) effect of physical activity on positive affect, which was positive in nearly all individuals. Conclusion: This study showed that the association between physical activity and affect varied considerably across individuals. Thus, while at the group level the effect of physical activity on affect may be small, in some individuals the effect may be clinically relevant.

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

  abstract = {Forbes, Wright, Markon, and Krueger (2017) make a compelling case for proceeding cautiously with respect to the overinterpretation and dissemination of results using the increasingly popular approach of creating 'networks' from co-occurrences of psychopathology symptoms. We commend the authors on their initial investigation and their utilization of cross-validation techniques in an effort to capture the stability of a variety of network estimation methods. Such techniques get at the heart of establishing 'reproducibility,' an increasing focus of concern in both psychology (e.g., Pashler \& Wagenmakers, 2012) and science more generally (e.g., Baker, 2016). However, as we will show, the problem is likely worse (or at least more complicated) than they initially indicated. Specifically, for multivariate binary data, the marginal distributions enforce a large degree of structure on the data. We show that some expected measurements—such as commonly used centrality statistics—can have substantially higher values than what would usually be expected. As such, we propose a nonparametric approach to generate confidence intervals through Monte Carlo simulation. We apply the proposed methodology to the National Comorbidity Survey – Replication, provided by Forbes et al., finding that the many of the results are indistinguishable from what would be expected by chance. Further, we discuss the problem of multiple testing and potential issues of applying methods developed for 1-mode networks (e.g., ties within a single set of observations) to 2-mode networks (e.g., ties between 2 distinct sets of entities). When taken together, these issues indicate that the psychometric network models should be employed with extreme caution and interpreted guardedly.

It seems a simple, even unassailable idea: Who would rise to argue in favor of a method of minimum likelihood, or even mediocre likelihood? And yet the mathematical history of the topic shows this “simple idea” is really anything but simple. Joseph Louis Lagrange, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonard Euler, Pierre Simon Laplace and Carl Friedrich Gauss are only some of those who explored the topic, not always in ways we would sanction today. In this article, that history is reviewed from back well before Fisher to the time of Lucien Le Cam’s dissertation. In the process Fisher’s unpublished 1930 characterization of conditions for the consistency and efficiency of maximum likelihood estimates is presented, and the mathematical basis of his three proofs discussed. In particular, Fisher’s derivation of the information inequality is seen to be derived from his work on the analysis of variance, and his later approach via estimating functions was derived from Euler’s Relation for homogeneous functions. The reaction to Fisher’s work is reviewed, and some lessons drawn.},

Here, we aimed to evaluate these properties for common measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire–9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment–7) in a large clinical sample (N = 22,362) undergoing psychotherapy. In addition, we tested consistency in dimensionality results across different methods (parallel analysis, factor analysis, explained common variance, the partial credit model, and the Mokken model). Results showed that while both Patient Health Questionnaire–9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment–7 are multidimensional instruments with highly correlated factors, there is justification for sum scores as measures of severity. Temporal measurement invariance across 10 therapy sessions was evaluated. Strict temporal measurement invariance was established in both scales, allowing researchers to compare sum scores as severity measures across time.},

Towards this end, we capitalize on recent breakthrough in network control theory, the engineering study of networked interventions, to investigate a representative psychological attitude modification experiment. This study examined 30 healthy participants who answered 11 questions about their attitude toward eating meat. They then received 11 arguments to challenge their attitude on the questions, after which they were asked again the same set of questions. Using this data, we constructed networks that quantify the connections between the responses and tested: 1) if the observed psychological effect, in terms of sensitivity and specificity, relates to the regional network topology as described by control theory, 2) if the size of change in responses relates to whole-network topology that quantifies the “ease” of change as described by control theory, and 3) if responses after intervention could be predicted based on formal results from control theory. We found that 1) the interventions that had higher regional topological relevance (the so-called controllability scores) had stronger effect (r {$>$} 0.5), the intervention sensitivities were systematically lower for the interventions that were “easier to control” (r = -0.49), and that the model offered substantial prediction accuracy (r = 0.36).  Finally, we compared results based on subjective as well as data-driven models and found that, across all tests, the results from the data-driven approach explained a larger size of effect. Taken together, our results suggest that psychological interventions can be studied using network control theory and that data-driven models provide a reliable medium.},

So wird etwa die therapeutische Beziehung in der Einzeltherapie oft als Bindungsbeziehung konzipiert. Im Bereich der Gruppenpsychotherapie wurde die Bindungstheorie inzwischen ebenfalls wahrgenommen und in einigen theoretischen Abhandlungen diskutiert. Empirisch wurden die Konzepte bislang zwar noch eher spärlich untersucht, es gibt aber durchaus Befunde zum Zusammenhang zwischen Bindungsmerkmalen und Gruppenprozessen in nichtklinischen Gruppen, zur Bedeutung dieser Merkmale für die Erwartungen und Einstellungen gegenüber Gruppen aufseiten von Therapeuten und Patienten in der Psychotherapie und zur Frage der Prognose von Gruppentherapien in Abhängigkeit von Bindungscharakteristika.},

  abstract = {Background Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes substantially to the burden of mood disorders and is undoubtedly an important subpopulation in whom there are clear unmet treatment needs. Despite a paucity of research focusing specifically on TRD, recent studies indicate that inflammatory activity may be particularly elevated in these patients. Methods 36 patients with TRD were investigated longitudinally before and after undertaking a specialist inpatient treatment program. 27 inflammatory proteins were compared between patients and a matched sample of non-depressed controls, as well as between treatment responders and non-responders. Treatment outcomes were calculated from depression severity scores before and after admission, and at a long-term follow-up 3–12 months after discharge. Results TRD patients had higher levels of numerous inflammatory proteins than controls, and elevated interleukins 6 and 8, tumour necrosis factor, c-reactive protein and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 were associated with poorer treatment outcomes. A separate set of proteins (either anti-inflammatory in nature or attenuated at baseline) showed increases during treatment, regardless of clinical response. Participants with the greatest elevations in inflammation tended to be older, more cognitively impaired and more treatment-resistant at baseline. Limitations The small sample and large number of comparisons examined in this study must be taken into account when interpreting these results. Conclusions However, this study provides empirical support for theories that more severe, chronic or treatment-resistant depressive disorders are associated with dysregulated inflammatory activity. If a predictor or predictors of response in TRD are established, improved and targeted care might be more reliably provided to this vulnerable population.},

In particular, there has been a recent proliferation of anxiety apps. However, there has been no review of the quality or content of these anxiety apps and little is known about their purpose, the features they contain, and their empirical support. The goal of this systematic review was to assess the commercially available anxiety apps. METHODS: A list of anxiety apps was collected in January 2017, using the Power Search function of iTunes and Google Play. Of 5,078 identified apps, 52 met our inclusion criteria (i.e., being defined as an anxiety/worry relief app, and offering psychological techniques aimed primarily at reducing anxiety) and were further reviewed. RESULTS: The majority (67.3\%) of the currently available anxiety apps were found to lack the involvement of health care professionals in their development, and very few (3.8\%) of them have been rigorously tested. CONCLUSIONS: At the moment, although anxiety apps have the potential to enhance access to mental health care, there is a marked discrepancy between the wealth of commercially available apps, and the paucity of data regarding their efficacy and effectiveness. Although the great promise of apps is their ability to increasing access to evidence-based mental health, the field is not quite there yet and the full potential of apps for treating anxiety has yet to be exploited.},

  abstract = {The present study examined the situations and conditions in which ruminative self-focus is less likely to occur in daily life. Previous researchers have described a mood-brightening effect of depression, where depressed individuals exhibit greater positive emotional reactivity to positive daily events than do nondepressed individuals. To better understand this paradoxical effect, we investigated the moderating role of depression in the relationship between daily activities and ruminative thinking. Forty-one Japanese undergraduates (9 women and 32 men) recorded their thought contents and the type and subjective appraisals of activities that they engaged in 8 times a day for a week at semirandom intervals. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that subjectively pleasant activities were associated with improved mood states and reduced ruminative thinking. However, some of these associations were moderated by depressive symptoms, suggesting that individuals with higher levels of depression showed a greater reduction of ruminative thinking during pleasant activities. These results imply that daily activities are important for reducing rumination, particularly for individuals with higher levels of depression, and that the brightening effect of depression is evident for cognitive as well as emotional activities. The cognitive basis of this paradoxical effect is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, it remains unclear whether patients with differing attachment classifications would behave and speak in distinct ways in group therapy sessions. Aim: In this study, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the discourse of patients in group therapy who had independently received different classifications with gold standard interview measures of attachment in adults. Each patient participant attended one of three mentalization-based parenting groups. Before treatment, the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) or the Parent Development Interview (PDI) were administered to each patient, and interviews were transcribed and coded to obtain the patient’s attachment classification. Groups included 2, 5, and 5 patients, respectively, and any session was led by at least two co-therapists. A total of 14 group sessions were transcribed verbatim. Sessions were analysed through a semi-inductive method, in order to identify markers that would typify patients of different attachment classifications in session. Through transcript excerpts and narrative descriptions, we report on the differing ways in which patients of different attachment classifications communicate in group psychotherapy, with the therapist and with each other. Our work provides useful information for group therapists and researchers regarding how differences in attachment status may play out in group sessions.},

Fifty therapists were administered the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), and therapy sessions with each therapist were rated with the TASc. Therapists also completed the WAI-T to assess the therapeutic alliance and divergent validity of the TASc. Results indicate strong inter-rater reliability and stability across consecutive sessions of the TASc, as well as high convergent validity between one session rated with the TASc and the AAI rated independently (κ~=~.81). No significant associations were found with the WAI-T, which offers preliminary evidence of divergent validity of the TASc. These results suggest that therapists of different attachment classifications may attune to patients in distinct ways. These results also present the TASc as a valid measure of therapists' attachment in psychotherapy and as a promising tool for training and supervision.},

Method: Before treatment, 160 patients in different types of psychotherapy and from three different countries were administered the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), which was rated with the RF scale. One early psychotherapy session for each patient was independently rated with the In-session RF scale and with the PACS Exploring scale. Results: Both scales were found to be reliable and to have concurrent validity with the RF scale rated on the AAI, with the PACS Exploring scale found to be a better predictor of RF on the AAI. Conclusions: These results suggest that the PACS Exploring scale might be a practical method for assessing RF in psychotherapy research and a way for researchers and clinicians to track patients’ RF on an ongoing basis. These results also provide information regarding the ways in which differences in RF manifest during psychotherapy sessions.Clinical or methodological significance of this article Researchers and clinicians can assess patients’ mentalizing based on any single psychotherapy transcript, in many therapeutic modalitiesThe Exploring scale of the Patient Attachment Coding System can yield a reliable measure of reflective functioning based on any single psychotherapy transcript, in many therapeutic modalitiesClient differences in mentalizing manifest in part independently of the therapist’s contributions},

  abstract = {In the last decade of his career, Jeremy Safran became increasingly interested in investigating the ways in which attachment representations influence the therapeutic relationship. In this paper, we test such influence in a sample of thirty outpatients who received Brief Relational Therapy by comparing their independently coded pre-treatment Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) with their narratives in a post-treatment interview about the relationship with the therapist (the Patient Relationship Interview at Termination, PRI-T). The PRI-T was coded with the following three measures: i) The Patient Attachment to Therapist Rating Scale (PAT-RS), which assesses the quality of the patient’s attachment relationship to the therapist; ii) the Coherence scale from the AAI, adapted for use on the PRI-T; and iii) the Patient Attachment Classification System (PACS), which measures generalized differences in how individuals convey their experiences and feelings. Results suggest that patients’ AAI predicts how they experience, represent, and communicate about the therapeutic relationship at the end of treatment, as shown by the PAT-RS, the Coherence scale adapted for use on the PRI-T, and the PACS applied to the PRI-T. These findings lend support to Safran and others’ hypothesis that patients’ AAI-status plays a role in patients’ representations of the relationship with the therapist.},

This tutorial is aimed at providing such a resource. In addition to explaining the different components of BART using simple examples, we also discuss a framework, the General BART model that unifies some of the recent BART extensions, including semiparametric models, correlated outcomes, and statistical matching problems in surveys, and models with weaker distributional assumptions. By showing how these models fit into a single framework, we hope to demonstrate a simple way of applying BART to research problems that go beyond the original independent continuous or binary outcomes framework.},

  abstract = {A long tradition in decision making assumes that people usually take a consequentialist perspective, which implies a focus on the outcomes only when making decisions. Such a view largely neglects the existence of a deontological perspective, which implies that people are sensitive to moral duties that require or prohibit certain behaviors, irrespective of the consequences. Similarly, recent research has also suggested that people holding “protected values” (PVs) show increased attention to acts versus omissions and less attention to outcomes. The present research investigates the role of deontological versus consequentialist modes of thought and of PVs on framing effects and act versus omission choices. In a modification of Tversky and Kahneman's (1981) risky choice framing paradigm, we manipulated the framing of the outcomes (positive, negative), as well as whether the certain outcome was associated with an act or inaction. The main results suggest that act versus omission tendencies are linked to deontological focus and PVs. Framing effects, on the other hand, are driven by a consequentialist focus.

  abstract = {With the impressive growth of available data and the flexibility of network modelling, the problem of devising effective quantitative methods for the comparison of networks arises. Plenty of such methods have been designed to accomplish this task: most of them deal with undirected and unweighted networks only, but a few are capable of handling directed and/or weighted networks too, thus properly exploiting richer information. In this work, we contribute to the effort of comparing the different methods for comparing networks and providing a guide for the selection of an appropriate one. First, we review and classify a collection of network comparison methods, highlighting the criteria they are based on and their advantages and drawbacks. The set includes methods requiring known node-correspondence, such as DeltaCon and Cut Distance, as well as methods not requiring a priori known node-correspondence, such as alignment-based, graphlet-based, and spectral methods, and the recently proposed Portrait Divergence and NetLSD. We test the above methods on synthetic networks and we assess their usability and the meaningfulness of the results they provide. Finally, we apply the methods to two real-world datasets, the European Air Transportation Network and the FAO Trade Network, in order to discuss the results that can be drawn from this type of analysis.},

  abstract = {The application of attachment theory to adult psychotherapy represents a growing area of research and practice. Despite the conceptual overlap between group therapeutic factors, attachment theory, and therapeutic tasks as outlined by Bowlby (1988), there is little research on attachment functioning in group therapy. Hence, there remain substantial questions about the role of attachment theory in understanding group therapy processes and outcomes. The three studies in this special section advance the research in some of these important areas, including showing that positive changes in self-reported attachment insecurity among clients persist long after group therapy ends; attachment anxiety affects the level and rate of interpersonal learning in groups; and change in attachment to the therapy group has an impact on longer term change in individual group members' attachment. Each article also examines the impact of these attachment concepts on treatment outcomes. Numerous areas remain to be explored when it comes to the implications of attachment theory for understanding and conducting group therapy, including the conceptual and practical overlap between attachment concepts such as security and exploration with group therapeutic factors such as cohesion and interpersonal learning. The articles in this special section begin to address some of these issues related to attachment theory and its implications for group therapists.},

Attachment was measured using the Attachment Styles Questionnaire (Feeney, Noller, \& Hanrahan, 1994). As hypothesized, self-reports of high avoidant attachment predicted noncompletion of treatment for those with AN binge-purge subtype (ANB). However, this relationship did not emerge for those with AN restricting subtype (ANR). Also as hypothesized, self-reports of high anxious attachment predicted completing treatment for those with ANB but not for those with ANR. For completers with ANB and ANR, the program was helpful in increasing body weight and lowering drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, interpersonal problems, and depression. Attachment avoidance, characterized by devaluing one's need for relationships, may be a contraindication for group-based partial hospital treatment of ANB. Attachment anxiety, characterized by high preoccupation with relationships, may facilitate remaining in treatment for those with ANB.},

  abstract = {Résumé Resumen Patients (N=135) with binge eating disorder (BED) were randomized to a control condition or to one of two 16-session group treatments: group cognitive–behavioral therapy (GCBT) or group psychodynamic interpersonal psychotherapy (GPIP). The two treatments performed equally well, and each resulted in reduced days binged compared with the wait-list control condition. Twelve-month follow-up indicated that improvements were maintained in days binged and in other outcome variables. For women who completed GPIP, higher attachment anxiety was related to improvements in days binged by posttreatment. On the other hand, for women who completed GCBT, lower attachment anxiety was associated with improvements in days binged by posttreatment. Higher attachment avoidance was related to dropping out of GCBT. Although both GPIP and GCBT reduced binge eating, the results indicated that individual outcomes differ across treatments based on level of attachment anxiety and avoidance. Zusammenfassung Bindungsskalen sagen den Erfolg in einer randomisierten und kontrollierten Studie mit zwei Gruppentherapien für Essanfallstörungen voraus: Eine Interaktion von Fähigkeit und Behandlung 135 Patienten mit Essanfallstörungen wurden dem Zufall nach entweder einer Kontrollbedingung oder einer von zwei 16-stündigen Gruppentherapien zugeordnet: kognitiv verhaltensmäßige Gruppentherapie (group cognitive-behavioral therapy, GCBT) oder psychodynamisch interpersonelle Gruppentherapie (group psychodynamic interpersonal therapy, GPIP). Die beiden Behandlungen waren in gleichem Maße erfolgreich und erbrachten im Vergleich zur Kontrollbedingung eine Reduzierung bezüglich der Tage mit Essanfällen. Eine Katamnese nach zwölf Monaten erbrachte stabile Werte hinsichtlich dieses Ergebnisses und auch bezüglich anderer Ergebnisvariablen. Frauen, die GPIP durchlaufen hatten, zeigten aber in der Katamnese Leser eine höhere Bindungsangst im Zusammenhang mit der Reduktion ihrer Essanfälle. Bei Frauen mit GCBT war das anders: eine Reduktion der Essanfälle wies eine Beziehung zu geringer Bindungsangst auf. Höhere Werte in der Bindungsvermeidung waren bei GCBT mit Drop-out Verhalten verbunden. Obwohl GPIP und GCBT beide Essanfälle verringern, stellen sich die individuellen Ergebnisse aufgrund von Bindungsangst und Bindungsvermeidung bei einem Therapievergleich doch unterschiedlich dar. Des échelles d'attachement prédisent les résultats dans une étude contrôlée randomisée de deux thérapies de groupe pour le binge eating. : une interaction aptitude / traitement. Des patients (N = 135) souffrant de binge eating (BED) étaient attribués au hasard à soit une condition de contrôle soit un des deux traitements de groupe à 16 séances chacune : thérapie de groupe cognitivo-comportementale (GCBT) ou thérapie de groupe psychodynamique interpersonnelle (GPIP). Les deux traitements se valaient en efficacité, et chacun aboutissait à un nombre diminué de journées avec binge eating, en comparaison avec le groupe de contrôle. La catamnèse de 12 mois indiquait que les améliorations concernant les journées de binge eating et d'autres paramètres de résultats étaient maintenues. Pour des finisseurs de GPIP féminins, une anxiété d'attachement plus élevée avait un lien avec les améliorations de binge eating à la catamnèse. De l'autre côté, chez des finisseurs féminins de GCBT, une anxiété d'attachement plus faible était liée à une amélioration du binge eating à la catamnèse. Un attachement évitant élevé était lié à une rupture précoce en GCBT. Alors que GPIP et GCBT réduisaient le binge eating dans la même mesure, les résultats indiquent que les issues individuelles diffèrent entre les traitements en fonction des niveaux d'attachement anxieux et évitant. Terapias para desórdenes bulímicos. Una aptitud para la interacción de tratamientos. Se randomizaron pacientes (N=135) con desorden bulímico (BED) para control o para uno de dos tratamientos grupales de 16 sesiones: terapia cognitivo-comportamental grupal (GCBT) o Terapia gupal psicodinámica interpersonal (GPIP). Los dos tratamientos funcionaron igualmente bien y redujeron los días de bulimia comparados con los pacientes control en lista de espera. El seguimiento a los doce meses indicó que las mejorías se mantenían en cuanto a días de bulimia y otras variables de resultado. Para mujeres que completaron el GPIP, la mayor ansiedad de apego se relacionó con mejorías en los días de bulimia en el postratamiento. Por otra parte, para las mujeres que completaron el GCBT, la menor ansiedad de apego se asoció con mejorías en los días de bulimia posteriores al tratamiento. Una mayor evitación del apego se relacionó con la deserción del GCBT. Si bien tanto el GPIP como el GCBT redujeron la bulimia, los resultados indicaron que los resultados individuales difieren de los de tratamientos basados en el nivel de ansiedad de apego y evitación. Resumo Escalas de Vinculação predizem o Resultado Terapêutico num Ensaio Clínico Controlado de Duas Terapias de Grupo para a Perturbação de Ingestão Alimentar Compulsiva: Uma Interacção do Aptidão-Tratamento Pacientes (N = 135) com perturbação de ingestão alimentar compulsiva (IAC) foram aleatoriamente distribuídos para uma condição de controlo ou um de dois tratamentos de 16 sessões de grupo: terapia cognitivo-comportamental de grupo (TCCG) ou terapia interpessoal psicodinâmica de grupo (TIPG). Os dois tratamentos foram igualmente eficazes e em ambos se verificou uma redução dias com episódios de ingestão alimentar compulsiva quando comparados com a condição de controlo dos pacientes em lista de espera. Doze meses de seguimento revelaram que as melhorias se mantiveram em relação ao número de dias com ingestão alimentar compulsiva e a outras variáveis terapêuticas. Para as mulheres que completaram o TIPG, maior vinculação ansiosa estava relacionada com melhoria no número de dias com ingestão alimentar compulsiva no período de pós-tratamento. Por outro lado, para as mulheres que completaram o TCCG, uma baixa vinculação ansiosa estava associada com melhorias no número de dias com ingestão alimentar compulsiva no período de pós-tratamento. Uma elevada vinculação evitante foi relacionada com o abandono na TCCG. Embora tanto a TCCG como a TIPG tenham reduzido a ingestão alimentar compulsiva, os resultados indicaram que os resultados terapêuticos individuais diferem entre os dois tratamentos baseados no nível da vinculação ansiosa e evitante. Sommario In un esperimento controllato randomizzato, le Attachment Scales (scale dell'attaccamento) predicono l'esito di due terapie di gruppo per il disturbo da alimentazione incontrollata: una possibilità mediante interazioni tra i trattamenti I pazienti (n. 135) con disturbo da alimentazione incontrollata (Binge Eating Disorder - BED) sono stati assegnati casualmente ad un gruppo di controllo o ad uno dei seguenti due trattamenti di gruppo di 16 sedute: terapia cognitivo-comportamentale di gruppo (Group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy - GCBT) o terapia interpersonale psicodinamica di gruppo (Group Psychodynamic Interpersonal Therapy - GPIP). I due trattamenti hanno avuto esiti ugualmente buoni e ciascuno ha prodotto una riduzione dei giorni di alimentazione incontrollata rispetto alla situazione di controllo della lista d'attesa. Il follow-up a 12 mesi ha indicato che i miglioramenti erano mantenuti sia nei giorni di alimentazione incontrollata, che in altre variabili di esito. Per le donne che hanno completato la GPIP, l'ansia da attaccamento più elevata è stata correlata con i miglioramenti, dopo il trattamento, nei giorni di alimentazione incontrollata. D'altra parte, per le donne che hanno completato la GCBT, è stata l'ansia da attaccamento più bassa ad essere associata con i miglioramenti, dopo il trattamento, nei giorni di alimentazione incontrollata. Il più elevato evitamento nell'attaccamento è stato correlato con il drop-out della GCBT.Sebbene sia la GPIP che la GCBT hanno ridotto il disturbo da alimentazione incontrollata, i risultati indicano che nei trattamenti gli esiti individuali differiscono a seconda del livello di evitamento e di ansia nell'attaccamento.},

  abstract = {Objective Attachment insecurity is a potential risk factor for the development and maintenance of eating disorders (EDs). To date, there are multiple psychometrically sound questionnaires for the evaluation of attachment in both clinical and healthy populations, such as the Experience in Close Relationships (ECR) scale. Composed by two subscales (i.e., attachment anxiety and avoidance), the ECR scale was recently adapted to a shorter, 12-item version (ECR-12). However, a validation of the ECR-12 among patients with EDs is still lacking. The present study sought to investigate the psychometric properties of the ECR-12, when used in a treatment-seeking sample with EDs. Method A total of 1,262 treatment-seeking patients with various ED diagnoses completed the ECR-12, together with a commonly used measure of ED psychopathology (Eating Disorder Inventory-2). Subsamples also completed the Attachment Style Questionnaire (n = 66) or underwent a Day Hospital Program (n = 128). Results A multigroup confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the ECR-12 maintained its two-factor structure across the ED diagnostic groups. In addition, the scale demonstrated good convergent validity, internal consistency, concurrent, and incremental validity. Finally, both ECR-12 subscales demonstrated adequate test–retest reliability. Discussion Our results provide preliminary evidence of the psychometric properties of ECR-12 in assessing attachment anxiety and avoidance among patients with EDs. This short scale could help clinicians tailor interventions for EDs that take into account attachment dimensions.},

  abstract = {Background Actigraphy has enabled consecutive observation of individual health conditions such as sleep or daily activity. This study aimed to examine the usefulness of actigraphy in evaluating depressive and/or bipolar disorder symptoms. Method A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. We selected studies that used actigraphy to compare either patients vs. healthy controls, or pre- vs. post-treatment data from the same patient group. Common actigraphy measurements, namely daily activity and sleep-related data, were extracted and synthesized. Results Thirty-eight studies (n\,=\,3,758) were included in the analysis. Compared with healthy controls, depressive patients were less active (standardized mean difference; SMD=1.27, 95\%CI=[0.97, 1.57], P{$<$}0.001) and had longer wake after sleep onset (SMD=\,−\,0.729, 95\%CI=[−\,1.20, −\,0.25], p\,=\,0.003). Total sleep time (SMD=\,−\,0.33, 95\%CI=[−\,0.55, −\,0.11], P\,=\,0.004), sleep latency (SMD=\,−\,0.22, 95\%CI=[−\,0.42, −\,0.02], P\,=\,0.032), and wake after sleep onset (SMD=\,−\,0.22, 95\%CI=[−\,0.39, −\,0.04], P\,=\,0.015) were longer in euthymic/remitted patients compared to healthy controls. In pre- and post-treatment comparisons, sleep latency (SMD=−\,0.85, 95\%CI=[−\,1.53, −\,0.17], P\,=\,0.015), wake after sleep onset (SMD=\,−\,0.65, 95\%CI=[−\,1.20, −\,0.10], P\,=\,0.022), and sleep efficiency (SMD=0.77, 95\%CI=[0.29, 1.24], P\,=\,0.002) showed significant improvement. Limitation The sample sizes for each outcome were small. The type of actigraphy devices and patients’ illness severity differed across studies. It is possible that hospitalizations and medication influenced the outcomes. Conclusion We found significant differences between healthy controls and mood disorders patients for some actigraphy-measured modalities. Specific measurement patterns characterizing each mood disorder/status were also found. Additional actigraphy data linked to severity and/or treatment could enhance the clinical utility of actigraphy.},

  abstract = {The combination of network theory and network psychometric methods has opened up a variety of new ways to conceptualize and study psychological disorders. The idea of psychological disorders as dynamic systems has sparked interest in developing interventions based on results of network analytic tools. However, simply estimating a network model is not sufficient for determining which symptoms might be most effective to intervene upon, nor is it sufficient for determining the potential efficacy of any given intervention. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this gap by introducing fundamental concepts of control theory to both psychometricians and applied psychologists. We introduce two controllability statistics to the psychometric literature, average and modal controllability, to facilitate selecting the best set of intervention targets. Following this introduction, we show how intervention scientists can probe the effects of both theoretical and empirical interventions on networks derived from real data and demonstrate how simulations can account for intervention cost and the desire to reduce specific symptoms. Every step is based on rich clinical EMA data from a sample of subjects undergoing treatment for complicated grief, with a focus on the outcome suicidal ideation. All methods are implemented in an open-source R package netcontrol, and complete code for replicating the analyses in this manuscript are available online.},

  abstract = {Background The network approach to psychopathology conceives mental disorders as sets of symptoms causally impacting on each other. The strengths of the connections between symptoms are key elements in the description of those symptom networks. Typically, the connections are analysed as linear associations (i.e., correlations or regression coefficients). However, there is insufficient awareness of the fact that differences in variance may account for differences in connection strength. Differences in variance frequently occur when subgroups are based on skewed data. An illustrative example is a study published in PLoS One (2013;8(3):e59559) that aimed to test the hypothesis that the development of psychopathology through “staging” was characterized by increasing connection strength between mental states. Three mental states (negative affect, positive affect, and paranoia) were studied in severity subgroups of a general population sample. The connection strength was found to increase with increasing severity in six of nine models. However, the method used (linear mixed modelling) is not suitable for skewed data. Methods We reanalysed the data using inverse Gaussian generalized linear mixed modelling, a method suited for positively skewed data (such as symptoms in the general population). Results The distribution of positive affect was normal, but the distributions of negative affect and paranoia were heavily skewed. The variance of the skewed variables increased with increasing severity. Reanalysis of the data did not confirm increasing connection strength, except for one of nine models. Conclusions Reanalysis of the data did not provide convincing evidence in support of staging as characterized by increasing connection strength between mental states. Network researchers should be aware that differences in connection strength between symptoms may be caused by differences in variances, in which case they should not be interpreted as differences in impact of one symptom on another symptom.},

Methods A search of electronic databases and authors' own bibliographic libraries was performed between 2006 and 2007 for original research articles investigating associations between PA and depression in adults. A total of 27 observational and 40 intervention studies were included. Results Of the studies that focused on the association between duration of PA and likelihood of depression, all five observational studies, and five of the seven intervention studies found both shorter and longer durations of PA were associated with reduced likelihood of depression. Of the studies that focused on the association between intensity of PA and likelihood of depression, four of the six observational studies found that vigorous-intensity PA was more strongly associated with decreased likelihood of depression than lower intensities. Most intervention studies showed that both intensities were effective in reducing the likelihood of depression. Two observational studies found a stronger inverse relationship of leisure-time PA with depression than PA in other domains. There is insufficient evidence regarding the importance of the PA setting on depression. Conclusion Although the dose and domain of physical activity varied across studies reviewed, evidence suggests that even low doses of PA may be protective against depression. Further studies examining the optimal domain of PA for reducing the likelihood of depression are needed.},

A core principle is the need to shift the level at which selection operates, from individuals to the groups in which individuals are embedded. This principle is used in several fields to improve collective outcomes, including animal husbandry, professional sports, and professional organizations. Shifting the level of selection has the potential to ameliorate several problems in contemporary science, including accounting for scientists’ indirect contributions, reducing individual-level competition, and promoting specialization.

  abstract = {Introduction Blended therapies (BT) combine face-to-face (f2f) sessions with internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). However, the use of blended interventions in routine care is still rare and depends on the acceptance of key health care professionals such as the therapists. Little is yet known about the therapists' perspective on and experiences with blended approaches. The aim of this pilot study was to identify barriers and facilitators, as perceived by psychotherapists, for implementing a blended therapy for depression. Methods Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with five therapists, who were part of the German study arm of the FP7-project E-Compared (www.e-compared.eu). All patients (N\,=\,173) were treated in the context of a registered RCT (DRKS00006866) in which the clinical and cost-effectiveness of BT for depression, consisting of ten internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy modules and six f2f sessions, was compared to the treatment usually provided by general practitioners. To identify barriers and facilitators an interview guide based on the theoretical domains framework (TDF) was developed. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a qualitative content analysis by two independent coders. Results The results revealed 29 barriers and 33 facilitators, which are hindering or enabling factors on the levels of ‘implementation in the health care system’, ‘therapy’, ‘therapists’ and ‘patients’. Key barriers stated by all therapists were ‘Limited customizability and autonomy of decisions concerning blending the therapy’ (number of statements, k\,=\,44); ‘Disease-related contraindications for BT’ (k\,=\,25); ‘Negative affect was caused by burden through technical problems’ (k\,=\,18); ‘Limited number of f2f sessions hindered the therapy process’; and ‘Establishment of therapeutic alliance was burdened by technical issues’ (each k\,=\,15). Key facilitators stated by all therapists were: ‘Patients’ interest, willingness and motivation to participate’ (k\,=\,22); ‘Patients' access to online content between f2f sessions and after therapy end’ (k\,=\,20); ‘Preset structure of IMI-part guided the treatment course of BT’ (k\,=\,18); and ‘Effective help with BT in a short time frame’ (k\,=\,15), as well as ‘Reduction of the treatment gap’ (k\,=\,13). Discussion Therapists supported the implementation of BT for depression. Results indicated the consideration of a wide range of determinants: among others, the possibility of individualizing the treatment; the autonomy of decision making in respect to the ratio and number of online and f2f sessions; the necessity of providing training; the need to develop a concept of embedding BT in the health care system and funding the additional effort; and the use of sophisticated technical solutions.},

  abstract = {Since 1997, there has been increasing research focusing on muscle dysmorphia, a condition underpinned by people’s beliefs that they have insufficient muscularity, in both the Western and non-Western medical and scientific communities. Much of this empirical interest has surveyed nonclinical samples, and there is limited understanding of people with the condition beyond knowledge about their characteristics. Much of the existing knowledge about people with the condition is unsurprising and inherent in the definition of the disorder, such as dissatisfaction with muscularity and adherence to muscle-building activities. Only recently have investigators started to explore questions beyond these limited tautological findings that may give rise to substantial knowledge advances, such as the examination of masculine and feminine norms. There is limited understanding of additional topics such as etiology, prevalence, nosology, prognosis, and treatment. Further, the evidence is largely based on a small number of unstandardized case reports and descriptive studies (involving small samples), which are largely confined to Western (North American, British, and Australian) males. Although much research has been undertaken since the term “muscle dysmorphia” entered the psychiatric lexicon in 1997, there remains tremendous scope for knowledge advancement. A primary task in the short term is for investigators to examine the extent to which the condition exists among well-defined populations to help determine the justification for research funding relative to other public health issues. A greater variety of research questions and designs may contribute to a broader and more robust knowledge base than currently exists. Future work will help clinicians assist a group of people whose quality of life and health are placed at risk by their muscular preoccupation.},

Research code is typically created by a group of scientists and published together with academic papers to facilitate research transparency and reproducibility. For this study, we define ten questions to address aspects impacting research reproducibility and reuse. First, we retrieve and analyze more than 2000 replication datasets with over 9000 unique R files published from 2010 to 2020. Second, we execute the code in a clean runtime environment to assess its ease of reuse. Common coding errors were identified, and some of them were solved with automatic code cleaning to aid code execution. We find that 74\% of R files failed to complete without error in the initial execution, while 56\% failed when code cleaning was applied, showing that many errors can be prevented with good coding practices. We also analyze the replication datasets from journals’ collections and discuss the impact of the journal policy strictness on the code re-execution rate. Finally, based on our results, we propose a set of recommendations for code dissemination aimed at researchers, journals, and repositories.},

  abstract = {Exposure to psychological trauma (for example, childhood/early life adversity, exposure to violence or assault, combat exposure, accidents or natural disasters) is known to increase one's risk of developing certain chronic medical conditions. Clinical and population studies provide evidence of systemic inflammatory activity in trauma survivors with various psychiatric and nonpsychiatric conditions. This transdiagnostic meta-analysis quantitatively integrates the literature on the relationship of inflammatory biomarkers to trauma exposure and related symptomatology. We conducted random effects meta-analyses relating trauma exposure to log-transformed inflammatory biomarker concentrations, using meta-regression models to test the effects of study quality and psychiatric symptomatology on the inflammatory outcomes. Across k=36 independent samples and n=14,991 participants, trauma exposure was positively associated with C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (mean rs =0.2455, 0.3067, 0.2890, and 0.2998, respectively). No significant relationships were noted with fibrinogen, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, or IL-10. In meta-regression models, the presence of psychiatric symptoms was a significant predictor of increased effect sizes for IL-1β and IL-6 (β=1.0175 and 0.3568, respectively), whereas study quality assessment scores were associated with increased effect sizes for IL-6 (β=0.3812). Positive correlations between inflammation and trauma exposure across a range of sample types and diagnoses were found. Although reviewed studies spanned an array of populations, research on any one specific psychiatric diagnosis was generally limited to one or two studies. The results suggest that chronic inflammation likely represents one potential mechanism underlying risk of health problems in trauma survivors.},

Here, we review the topic of predictive uncertainty estimation with machine learning algorithms, as well as the related metrics (consistent scoring functions and proper scoring rules) for assessing probabilistic predictions. The review covers a time period spanning from the introduction of early statistical (linear regression and time series models, based on Bayesian statistics or quantile regression) to recent machine learning algorithms (including generalized additive models for location, scale and shape, random forests, boosting and deep learning algorithms) that are more flexible by nature. The review of the progress in the field, expedites our understanding on how to develop new algorithms tailored to users' needs, since the latest advancements are based on some fundamental concepts applied to more complex algorithms. We conclude by classifying the material and discussing challenges that are becoming a hot topic of research.},

  abstract = {Network psychometrics leverages pairwise Markov random fields to depict conditional dependencies among a set of psychological variables as undirected edge-weighted graphs. Researchers often intend to compare such psychometric networks across subpopulations, and recent methodological advances provide invariance tests of differences in subpopulation networks. What remains missing, though, is an analogue to an effect size measure that quantifies differences in psychometric networks. We address this gap by complementing recent advances for investigating whether psychometric networks differ with an intuitive similarity measure quantifying the extent to which networks differ. To this end, we build on graph-theoretic approaches and propose a similarity measure based on the Frobenius norm of differences in psychometric networks’ weighted adjacency matrices. To assess this measure’s utility for quantifying differences between psychometric networks, we study how it captures differences in subpopulation network models implied by both latent variable models and Gaussian graphical models. We show that a wide array of network differences translates intuitively into the proposed measure, while the same does not hold true for customary correlation-based comparisons. In a simulation study on finite-sample behavior, we show that the proposed measure yields trustworthy results when population networks differ and sample sizes are sufficiently large, but fails to identify exact similarity when population networks are the same. From these results, we derive a strong recommendation to only use the measure as a complement to a significant test for network similarity. We illustrate potential insights from quantifying psychometric network similarities through cross-country comparisons of human values networks.},

In an effort to bring the benefits of deep learning to psychologists, we provide an overview of deep learning for researchers who have a working knowledge of linear regression. We first discuss several benefits of the deep learning approach to predictive modeling. We then present three basic deep learning models that generalize linear regression: the feedforward neural network (FNN), the recurrent neural network (RNN), and the convolutional neural network (CNN). We include concrete toy examples with R code to demonstrate how each model may be applied to answer prediction-focused research questions using common data types collected by psychologists.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite the growing interest in the experience sampling method (ESM) as a data collection tool for mental health research, the absence of methodological guidelines related to its use has resulted in a large heterogeneity of designs. Concomitantly, the potential effects of the design on the response behavior of the participants remain largely unknown. Objective: The objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the associations between various sample and design characteristics and the compliance and retention rates of studies using ESM in mental health research. Methods: ESM studies investigating major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder were considered for inclusion. Besides the compliance and retention rates, a number of sample and design characteristics of the selected studies were collected to assess their potential relationships with the compliance and retention rates. Multilevel random/mixed effects models were used for the analyses. Results: Compliance and retention rates were lower for studies with a higher proportion of male participants (P\&lt;.001) and individuals with a psychotic disorder (P\&lt;.001). Compliance was positively associated with the use of a fixed sampling scheme (P=.02), higher incentives (P=.03), higher time intervals between successive evaluations (P=.02), and fewer evaluations per day (P=.008), while no significant associations were observed with regard to the mean age of the sample, the study duration, or other design characteristics. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that ESM studies can be carried out in mental health research, but the quality of the data collection depends upon a number of factors related to the design of ESM studies and the samples under study that need to be considered when designing such protocols.},

Recent evidence suggests that sedentary behaviors may also be associated with depression. Purpose To examine the associations of accelerometer-derived moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity and sedentary time with depression among a population-based sample. Methods Cross-sectional study using 2,862 adults from the 2005–2006 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. ActiGraph accelerometers were used to derive both moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity and sedentary time. Results Depression occurred in 6.8\% of the sample. For moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity, compared with those in quartile 1 (least active), significantly lower odds of depression were observed for those participants in quartiles 2 (OR=0.55, 95\% CI, 0.34 to 0.89), 3 (OR=0.49, 95\% CI, 0.26 to 0.93), and 4 (most active) (OR=0.37, 95\% CI, 0.20 to 0.70) (p for trend p{$<$}0.01). In overweight/obese participants only, those in quartile 4 (most sedentary) had significantly higher odds for depression than those in quartile 1 (least sedentary) [quartile 3 vs 1 (OR=1.94, 95\% CI, 1.01 to 3.68) and 4 vs 1 (OR=3.09, 95\% CI, 1.25 to 7.68)]. Conclusion The current study identified lower odds of depression were associated with increasing moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity and decreasing sedentary time, at least within overweight/obese adults.},

Applications of such network approaches to various psychological constructs have recently moved from a descriptive stance, in which the goal is to estimate the network structure that pertains to a construct, to a more comparative stance, in which the goal is to compare network structures across populations. However, the statistical tools to do so are lacking. In this article, we present the network comparison test (NCT), which uses resampling-based permutation testing to compare network structures from two independent, cross-sectional data sets on invariance of (a) network structure, (b) edge (connection) strength, and (c) global strength. Performance of NCT is evaluated in simulations that show NCT to perform well in various circumstances for all three tests: The Type I error rate is close to the nominal significance level, and power proves sufficiently high if sample size and difference between networks are substantial. We illustrate NCT by comparing depression symptom networks of males and females. Possible extensions of NCT are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).},

Sedentary behavior and low physical activity are independent yet modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality in these people. A comprehensive meta-analysis exploring these risk factors is lacking in this vulnerable population. We conducted a meta-analysis investigating sedentary behavior and physical activity levels and their correlates in people with severe mental illness. Major electronic databases were searched from inception up to April 2017 for articles measuring sedentary behavior and/or physical activity with a self-report questionnaire or an objective measure (e.g., accelerometer). Random effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Sixty-nine studies were included (N=35,682; 39.5\% male; mean age 43.0 years). People with severe mental illness spent on average 476.0 min per day (95\% CI: 407.3-545.4) being sedentary during waking hours, and were significantly more sedentary than age- and gender-matched healthy controls (p=0.003). Their mean amount of moderate or vigorous physical activity was 38.4 min per day (95\% CI: 32.0-44.8), being significantly lower than that of healthy controls (p=0.002 for moderate activity, p{$<$}0.001 for vigorous activity). People with severe mental illness were significantly less likely than matched healthy controls to meet physical activity guidelines (odds ratio = 1.5; 95\% CI: 1.1-2.0, p{$<$}0.001, I2=95.8). Lower physical activity levels and non-compliance with physical activity guidelines were associated with male gender, being single, unemployment, fewer years of education, higher body mass index, longer illness duration, antidepressant and antipsychotic medication use, lower cardiorespiratory fitness and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. People with bipolar disorder were the most physically active, yet spent most time being sedentary. Geographical differences were detected, and inpatients were more active than outpatients and those living in the community. Given the established health benefits of physical activity and its low levels in people with severe mental illness, future interventions specifically targeting the prevention of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior are warranted in this population.},

People with chronic low-grade inflammation may be at an increased risk of MDD, often in the form of sickness behaviors. We hypothesized that inflammation is predictive of the severity and the course of a subset of MDD symptoms, especially symptoms that overlap with sickness behavior, such as anhedonia, anorexia, low concentration, low energy, loss of libido, psychomotor slowness, irritability, and malaise. We tested the association between basal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory markers with individual MDD symptoms (measured using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report) over a period of up to 9 years using multivariate-adjusted mixed models in 1147–2872 Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) participants. At baseline, participants were on average 42.2 years old, 66.5\% were women and 53.9\% had a current mood or anxiety disorder. We found that basal and LPS-stimulated inflammatory markers were more strongly associated with sickness behavior symptoms at up to 9-year follow-up compared with non-sickness behavior symptoms of depression. However, we also found significant associations with some symptoms that are not typical of sickness behavior (e.g., sympathetic arousal among others). Inflammation was not related to depression as a unified syndrome but rather to the presence and the course of specific MDD symptoms, of which the majority were related to sickness behavior. Anti-inflammatory strategies should be tested in the subgroup of MDD patients who report depressive symptoms related to sickness behavior.},

  abstract = {In linear regression problems with many predictors, penalized regression techniques are often used to guard against overfitting and to select variables relevant for predicting an outcome variable. Recently, Bayesian penalization is becoming increasingly popular in which the prior distribution performs a function similar to that of the penalty term in classical penalization. Specifically, the so-called shrinkage priors in Bayesian penalization aim to shrink small effects to zero while maintaining true large effects. Compared to classical penalization techniques, Bayesian penalization techniques perform similarly or sometimes even better, and they offer additional advantages such as readily available uncertainty estimates, automatic estimation of the penalty parameter, and more flexibility in terms of penalties that can be considered. However, many different shrinkage priors exist and the available, often quite technical, literature primarily focuses on presenting one shrinkage prior and often provides comparisons with only one or two other shrinkage priors. This can make it difficult for researchers to navigate through the many prior options and choose a shrinkage prior for the problem at hand. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on Bayesian penalization. We provide a theoretical and conceptual comparison of nine different shrinkage priors and parametrize the priors, if possible, in terms of scale mixture of normal distributions to facilitate comparisons. We illustrate different characteristics and behaviors of the shrinkage priors and compare their performance in terms of prediction and variable selection in a simulation study. Additionally, we provide two empirical examples to illustrate the application of Bayesian penalization. Finally, an R package bayesreg is available online (https://github.com/sara-vanerp/bayesreg) which allows researchers to perform Bayesian penalized regression with novel shrinkage priors in an easy manner.},

This effect was not modified or confounded by chronic somatic disease. A persistent depression tended to be associated with incident excessive alcohol use (relative risk‐ratio 4.04; 95\% confidence interval 0.97–16.09; P=0.056).Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em}depression is associated with smoking behaviour, and with an increase in cigarette consumption.

Here we draw on the accumulated data collected with the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) to test the hypothesis that in clinical groups insecure attachment categories are overrepresented, in particular the insecure-unresolved category. Furthermore, we explore systematic patterns in the association between attachment representations and clinical disorders, in particular the potential link between dismissing attachments and externalizing problems compared to the possible overrepresentation of preoccupied and unresolved classifications in the case of internalizing disorders. Our previous meta-analysis focusing on these issues was conducted more than a decade ago. Because the number of AAI studies has increased dramatically (more than 9,000 individuals participated in the AAI since its inception), it is now time to take stock of the available evidence for a more grounded association between attachment representations and clinical disorders.

  abstract = {Theories are the vehicle of cumulative knowledge acquisition. At this time, however, many (developmental) psychological theories are insufficiently precise to derive testable hypotheses. This limits the advancement of our principled understanding of development. This problem cannot be resolved by improving the way deductive (confirmatory) research is conducted (e.g., through preregistration and replication), because theory formation requires inductive (exploratory) research. This paper argues that machine learning can help advance theory formation in (developmental) psychology, because it enables rigorous exploration of patterns in data. The paper discusses specific advantages of machine learning, explains core methodological concepts, introduces relevant methods, and describes how data-driven insights are consolidated into theory. Machine learning automates exploration, and incorporates checks and balances to ensure generalizable results. It can assist in phenomenon detection and offers a more holistic understanding of the phenomena associated with an outcome or process of interest.},

  abstract = {Background According to current classification systems, patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) may have very different combinations of symptoms. This symptomatic diversity hinders the progress of research into the causal mechanisms and treatment allocation. Theoretically founded subtypes of depression such as atypical, psychotic, and melancholic depression have limited clinical applicability. Data-driven analyses of symptom dimensions or subtypes of depression are scarce. In this systematic review, we examine the evidence for the existence of data-driven symptomatic subtypes of depression. Methods We undertook a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase in May 2012. We included studies analyzing the depression criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) of adults with MDD in latent variable analyses. Results In total, 1176 articles were retrieved, of which 20 satisfied the inclusion criteria. These reports described a total of 34 latent variable analyses: 6 confirmatory factor analyses, 6 exploratory factor analyses, 12 principal component analyses, and 10 latent class analyses. The latent class techniques distinguished 2 to 5 classes, which mainly reflected subgroups with different overall severity: 62 of 71 significant differences on symptom level were congruent with a latent class solution reflecting severity. The latent class techniques did not consistently identify specific symptom clusters. Latent factor techniques mostly found a factor explaining the variance in the symptoms depressed mood and interest loss (11 of 13 analyses), often complemented by psychomotor retardation or fatigue (8 of 11 analyses). However, differences in found factors and classes were substantial. Conclusions The studies performed to date do not provide conclusive evidence for the existence of depressive symptom dimensions or symptomatic subtypes. The wide diversity of identified factors and classes might result either from the absence of patterns to be found, or from the theoretical and modeling choices preceding analysis.},

  abstract = {Background Genetic risk and environmental adversity—both important risk factors for major depression (MD)—are thought to differentially impact on depressive symptom types and associations. Does heterogeneity in these risk factors result in different depressive symptom networks in patients with MD? Methods A clinical sample of 5784 Han Chinese women with recurrent MD were interviewed about their depressive symptoms during their lifetime worst episode of MD. The cases were classified into subgroups based on their genetic risk for MD (family history, polygenic risk score, early age at onset) and severe adversity (childhood sexual abuse, stressful life events). Differences in MD symptom network structure were statistically examined for these subgroups using permutation-based network comparison tests. Results Although significant differences in symptom endorsement rates were seen in 18.8\% of group comparisons, associations between depressive symptoms were similar across the different subgroups of genetic and environmental risk. Network comparison tests showed no significant differences in network strength, structure, or specific edges (P-value {$>$} 0.05) and correlations between edges were strong (0.60–0.71). Limitations This study analyzed depressive symptoms retrospectively reported by severely depressed women using novel statistical methods. Future studies are warranted to investigate whether similar findings hold in prospective longitudinal data, less severely depressed patients, and men. Conclusions Similar depressive symptom networks for MD patients with a higher or lower genetic or environmental risk suggest that differences in these etiological influences may produce similar symptom networks downstream for severely depressed women.},

We investigated the extent to which insomnia and sleep duration were associated with both current and remitted depressive and anxiety disorders in a large-scale epidemiologic study, taking sociodemographics, health factors, and medication use into account. METHOD: Data of 2,619 individuals from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) were analyzed. Psychopathology was classified as no, current, or remitted DSM-IV-based diagnosis of major depressive or anxiety disorder. Outcome measures were insomnia (Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale score {$>$}or= 9) and sleep duration ({$<$}or= 6 hours, 7-9 hours, {$>$}or= 10 hours). Baseline measurement was conducted between September 2004 and February 2007. RESULTS: Both current and remitted depressive disorder and current anxiety disorder were associated with insomnia and short sleep duration with odds ratios (ORs) for insomnia ranging from 1.42 to 3.23 and for short sleep duration ranging from 1.41 to 2.53. Associations were stronger for current than for remitted diagnoses and stronger for depressive than for anxiety disorders. Also long sleep duration was associated with current depressive disorder and anxiety disorders (OR range, 1.53-2.66). Sociodemographic factors, health indicators, and psychotropic medication use did contribute to sleep outcomes but could not explain much of the psychopathology and sleep associations. CONCLUSION: Depressive disorder-but also anxiety disorder-is strongly associated with sleep disturbances. Insomnia and short sleep duration persist after remittance of these disorders, suggesting that these are residual symptoms or possibly trait markers. Also, long sleep duration is associated with current depressive or anxiety disorders.},

  abstract = {Van Oest (2019) developed a framework to assess interrater agreement for nominal categories and complete data. We generalize this framework to all four situations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The mathematical solution yields a chance-corrected agreement coefficient that accommodates any weighting scheme for penalizing rater disagreements and any number of raters and categories. By incorporating Bayesian estimates of the category proportions, the generalized coefficient also captures situations in which raters classify only subsets of items; that is, incomplete data. Furthermore, this coefficient encompasses existing chance-corrected agreement coefficients: the S-coefficient, Scott’s pi, Fleiss’ kappa, and Van Oest’s uniform prior coefficient, all augmented with a weighting scheme and the option of incomplete data. We use simulation to compare these nested coefficients. The uniform prior coefficient tends to perform best, in particular, if one category has a much larger proportion than others. The gap with Scott’s pi and Fleiss’ kappa widens if the weighting scheme becomes more lenient to small disagreements and often if more item classifications are missing; missingness biases play a moderating role. The uniform prior coefficient often performs much better than the S-coefficient, but the S-coefficient sometimes performs best for small samples, missing data, and lenient weighting schemes. The generalized framework implies a new interpretation of chance-corrected weighted agreement coefficients: These coefficients estimate the probability that both raters in a pair assign an item to its correct category without guessing. Whereas Van Oest showed this interpretation for unweighted agreement, we generalize to weighted agreement. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Affective instability, the tendency to experience emotions that fluctuate frequently and intensively over time, is a core feature of several mental disorders including borderline personality disorder. Currently, affect is often measured with Ecological Momentary Assessment protocols, which yield the possibility to quantify the instability of affect over time. A number of linear mixed models are proposed to examine (diagnostic) group differences in affective instability. The models contribute to the existing literature by estimating simultaneously both the variance and serial dependency component of affective instability when observations are unequally spaced in time with the serial autocorrelation (or emotional inertia) declining as a function of the time interval between observations. In addition, the models can eliminate systematic trends, take between subject differences into account and test for (diagnostic) group differences in serial autocorrelation, short-term as well as long-term affective variability. The usefulness of the models is illustrated in a study on diagnostic group differences in affective instability in the domain of eating disorders. Limitations of the model are that they pertain to group (and not individual) differences and do not focus explicitly on circadian rhythms or cycles in affect.},

  abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is not only a threat to physical health but is also having severe impacts on mental health. Although increases in stress-related symptomatology and other adverse psycho-social outcomes, as well as their most important risk factors have been described, hardly anything is known about potential protective factors. Resilience refers to the maintenance of mental health despite adversity. To gain mechanistic insights about the relationship between described psycho-social resilience factors and resilience specifically in the current crisis, we assessed resilience factors, exposure to Corona crisis-specific and general stressors, as well as internalizing symptoms in a cross-sectional online survey conducted in 24 languages during the most intense phase of the lockdown in Europe (22 March to 19 April) in a convenience sample of N\,=\,15,970 adults. Resilience, as an outcome, was conceptualized as good mental health despite stressor exposure and measured as the inverse residual between actual and predicted symptom total score. Preregistered hypotheses (osf.io/r6btn) were tested with multiple regression models and mediation analyses. Results confirmed our primary hypothesis that positive appraisal style (PAS) is positively associated with resilience (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). The resilience factor PAS also partly mediated the positive association between perceived social support and resilience, and its association with resilience was in turn partly mediated by the ability to easily recover from stress (both p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). In comparison with other resilience factors, good stress response recovery and positive appraisal specifically of the consequences of the Corona crisis were the strongest factors. Preregistered exploratory subgroup analyses (osf.io/thka9) showed that all tested resilience factors generalize across major socio-demographic categories. This research identifies modifiable protective factors that can be targeted by public mental health efforts in this and in future pandemics.},

A test of caregiver sensitivity as the mechanism behind this intergenerational transmission showed an intriguing "transmission gap." Since then, the intergenerational transmission of attachment and the transmission gap have been studied extensively, and now extend to diverse populations from all over the globe. Two decades later, the current review revisited the effect sizes of intergenerational transmission, the heterogeneity of the transmission effects, and the size of the transmission gap. Analyses were carried out with a total of 95 samples (total N = 4,819). All analyses confirmed intergenerational transmission of attachment, with larger effect sizes for secure-autonomous transmission (r = .31) than for unresolved transmission (r = .21), albeit with significantly smaller effect sizes than 2 decades earlier (r = .47 and r = .31, respectively). Effect sizes were moderated by risk status of the sample, biological relatedness of child-caregiver dyads, and age of the children. Multivariate moderator analyses showed that unpublished and more recent studies had smaller effect sizes than published and older studies. Path analyses showed that the transmission could not be fully explained by caregiver sensitivity, with more recent studies narrowing but not bridging the "transmission gap." Implications for attachment theory as well as future directions for research are discussed.},

Hence, psychologists are making increasing use of such data, often with the intent to delineate the dynamic properties of psychological mechanisms, understood as a sequence of causal effects that govern psychological functioning. However, even with longitudinal data, psychological mechanisms are not easily identified. In this article, we show how an adequate representation of time may enhance the tenability of causal interpretations in the context of multivariate longitudinal data analysis. We anchor our considerations with an example that illustrates some of the main problems and questions faced by applied researchers and practitioners. We distinguish between static versus dynamic and discrete versus continuous time modeling approaches and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We place particular emphasis on different ways of addressing BP differences and stress their dual role as potential confounds versus valuable sources of information for improving estimation and aiding causal inference.

  abstract = {The vast majority of empirical research in the behavioral sciences is based on the analysis of between-person variation. In contrast, much of applied psychology is concerned with the analysis of variation within individuals. Furthermore, the mechanisms specified by psychological theories generally operate within, rather than across, individuals. This disconnect between research practice, applied demands, and psychological theories constitutes a major threat to the conceptual integrity of the field. Following groundbreaking earlier work, we propose a conceptual framework that distinguishes within-person (WP) and between-person (BP) sources of variation in psychological constructs. By simultaneously considering both sources of variation, it is shown how to identify possible reasons for nonequivalence of BP and WP structures as well as establishing areas of convergence. For this purpose, we first introduce the concept of conditional equivalence as a way to study partial structural equivalence of BP and WP structures in the presence of unconditional nonequivalence. Second, we demonstrate the construction of likelihood planes to explore the causes of structural nonequivalence. Third, we examine 4 common causes for unconditional nonequivalence—autoregression, subgroup differences, linear trends, and cyclic trends—and demonstrate how to account for them. Fourth, we provide an empirical example on BP and WP differences in attentiveness.},

To ensure the validity of the results obtained from analyzing the intensive longitudinal data (ILD), greater awareness and understanding of appropriate measurement practices are needed. We surveyed 42 researchers experienced with ILD on how they assess and account for measurement. Results showed that researchers typically use measures not validated specifically for ILD. Assessment of psychometric properties in the participants’ current studies and accounting for these properties when analyzing dynamics was even less common. Moreover, researchers often fail to assess measurement invariance; if tested, the required level of invariance is usually not achieved. However, open science practices appear reasonably well ingrained in ILD studies. We provide recommendations for best practices in ILD studies for creating a solid foundation for measuring and analyzing psychological constructs.},

If not captured, these changes might lead to invalid inferences about the constructs. Existing methodology can only test for a priori hypotheses on MM changes, which are often absent or incomplete. Therefore, we present the exploratory method “latent Markov factor analysis” (LMFA), wherein a latent Markov chain captures MM changes by clustering observations per subject into a few states. Specifically, each state gathers validly comparable observations, and state-specific factor analyses reveal what the MMs look like. LMFA performs well in recovering parameters under a wide range of simulated conditions, and its empirical value is illustrated with an example.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The complexity of psychopathology is evident from its multifactorial etiology and diversity of symptom profiles and hampers effective treatment. In psychotherapy, therapists approach this complexity by using case conceptualization. During this process, patients and therapists closely collaborate on a personalized working theory of the patient's psychopathology. This is a challenging process and shows low reliability between therapists. With the experience sampling method (ESM), time-series data-valuable for case conceptualization-can be systematically gathered in a patient's normal daily life. These data can be analyzed and visualized in person-specific networks (PSNs). PSNs may support case conceptualization by providing a schematic representation of association patterns between affective, cognitive, behavioral, and context variables. MAIN TEXT: We adopt a clinical perspective in considering how PSNs might be implemented to serve case conceptualization and what their role could be in psychotherapy. We suggest PSNs to be based on personalized ESM assessment to capture the unique constellation of variables in each patient. We reflect on the lack of a gold standard for creating PSNs, which may result in substantially different PSNs and thereby disparate information for case conceptualization. Moreover, even if PSNs are created in a consistent manner, results remain ambiguous as they are subject to multiple interpretations. Therefore, associations in PSNs do not allow for firm conclusions about a patient's psychopathology, but they may nevertheless be valuable in the process of case conceptualization. PSNs are based on systematically gathered, ecologically valid ESM data and provide a unique personalized perspective. When used responsibly, PSNs may be able to support case conceptualization by generating questions that serve as a starting point for a dialog between therapists and patients. Well-targeted questions are an essential tool for therapists to gain insight into the patients' psychopathology patterns and improve the quality of case conceptualization. CONCLUSIONS: PSNs have limitations in terms of the reliability of the insights they provide directly. However, taking these challenges into account, we believe they have potential as a tool to help therapists and patients in their collaborative exploration of a patient's psychopathology. Clearly, this would need to be validated in future clinical research.},

The focus is on a process of change in the sequences of interaction, which consist of the therapist's conclusion and the patient's response to it. In the conclusions, the therapist investigates and challenges the patient's tendency to transform her feelings of disappointment and anger into self-blame. Over the course of the therapy, the patient's responses to these conclusions are recast: from the patient first rejecting the conclusion, to then being ambivalent, and finally to agreeing with the therapist. On the basis of this case study, we suggest that an analysis that focuses on sequences of talk that are interactionally similar offers a sensitive method to investigate the manifestation of therapeutic change. It is suggested that this line of research can complement assimilation analysis and other methods of analyzing changes in a client's talk.},

  abstract = {Social scientists have become increasingly interested in using intensive longitudinal methods to study social phenomena that change over time. Many of these phenomena are expected to exhibit cycling fluctuations (e.g., sleep, mood, sexual desire). However, researchers typically employ analytical methods which are unable to model such patterns. We present spectral and cross-spectral analysis as means to address this limitation. Spectral analysis provides a means to interrogate time series from a different, frequency domain perspective, and to understand how the time series may be decomposed into their constituent periodic components. Cross-spectral extends this to dyadic data and allows for synchrony and time offsets to be identified. The techniques are commonly used in the physical and engineering sciences, and we discuss how to apply these popular analytical techniques to the social sciences while also demonstrating how to undertake estimations of significance and effect size. In this tutorial we begin by introducing spectral and cross-spectral analysis, before demonstrating its application to simulated univariate and bivariate individual- and group-level data. We employ cross-power spectral density techniques to understand synchrony between the individual time series in a dyadic time series, and circular statistics and polar plots to understand phase offsets between constituent periodic components. Finally, we present a means to undertake nonparameteric bootstrapping in order to estimate the significance, and derive a proxy for effect size. A Jupyter Notebook (Python 3.6) is provided as supplementary material to aid researchers who intend to apply these techniques. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

This assumption is infrequently carefully tested in data. We develop a statistically principled method to directly estimate the correlation between latent components of cognitive processing across tasks, contexts, and time. This method simultaneously estimates individual-participant parameters of a cognitive model at each testing occasion, group-level parameters representing across-participant parameter averages and variances, and across-task correlations. The approach provides a natural way to “borrow” strength across testing occasions, which can increase the precision of parameter estimates across all testing occasions. Two example applications demonstrate that the method is practical in standard designs. The examples, and a simulation study, also provide evidence about the reliability and validity of parameter estimates from the linear ballistic accumulator model. We conclude by highlighting the potential of the parameter-correlation method to provide an “assumption-light” tool for estimating the relatedness of cognitive processes across tasks, contexts, and time.},

Combining multiple forecasts produced for a target time series is now widely used to improve accuracy through the integration of information gleaned from different sources, thereby avoiding the need to identify a single “best” forecast. Combination schemes have evolved from simple combination methods without estimation to sophisticated techniques involving time-varying weights, nonlinear combinations, correlations among components, and cross-learning. They include combining point forecasts and combining probabilistic forecasts. This paper provides an up-to-date review of the extensive literature on forecast combinations and a reference to available open-source software implementations. We discuss the potential and limitations of various methods and highlight how these ideas have developed over time. Some crucial issues concerning the utility of forecast combinations are also surveyed. Finally, we conclude with current research gaps and potential insights for future research.},

  abstract = {A just-in-time, adaptive intervention (JITAI) is an emerging type of intervention that provides tailored support at the exact time of need. It does so using enabling new technologies (e.g., mobile phones, sensors) that capture the changing states of individuals. Extracting effect sizes of primary outcomes produced by 33 empirical studies that used JITAIs, we found moderate to large effect sizes of JITAI treatments compared to (1) waitlist-control conditions (k = 9), Hedges’s g = 1.65 and (2) non-JITAI treatments (k = 21), g = 0.89. Also, participants of JITAI interventions showed significant changes (k = 13) in the positive direction (g = 0.79). A series of sensitivity tests suggested that those effects persist. Those effects also persist despite differences in the behaviors of interests (e.g., blood glucose control, recovering alcoholics), duration of the treatments, and participants’ age. Two aspects of tailoring, namely: (1) tailoring to what (i.e., both people’s previous behavioral patterns and their current need states; with these effects additive) and (2) approach to tailoring (i.e., both using a human agent and an algorithm to decide tailored feedback; with these effects additive), are significantly associated with greater JITAI efficacy.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite decades of research, the current suicide rate is nearly identical to what it was 100 years ago. This slow progress is due, at least in part, to a lack of formal theories of suicide. Existing suicide theories are instantiated verbally, omitting details required for precise explanation and prediction, rendering them difficult to effectively evaluate and difficult to improve. By contrast, formal theories are instantiated mathematically and computationally, allowing researchers to precisely deduce theory predictions, rigorously evaluate what the theory can and cannot explain, and thereby, inform how the theory can be improved. This paper takes the first step toward addressing the need for formal theories in suicide research by formalizing an initial, general theory of suicide and evaluating its ability to explain suicide-related phenomena. Methods: First, we formalized a General Escape Theory of Suicide as a system of stochastic and ordinary differential equations. Second, we used these equations to simulate behavior of the system over time. Third, we evaluated if the formal theory produced robust suicide-related phenomena including rapid onset and brief duration of suicidal thoughts, and zero-inflation of suicidal thinking in time series data. Results: Simulations successfully produced the proposed suicidal phenomena (i.e., rapid onset, short duration, and high zero-inflation of suicidal thoughts in time series data). Notably, these simulations also produced theorized phenomena following from the General Escape Theory of Suicide: that suicidal thoughts emerge when alternative escape behaviors failed to effectively regulate aversive internal states, and that effective use of long-term strategies may prevent the emergence of suicidal thoughts.   Conclusions: To our knowledge, the model developed here is the first formal theory of suicide, which was able to produce – and, thus, explain – well-established phenomena documented in the suicide literature. We discuss the next steps in a research program dedicated to studying suicide as a complex dynamical system, and describe how the integration of formal theories and empirical research may advance our understanding, prediction, and prevention of suicide.},

Since its “discovery” in 2012, hundreds of studies have been dedicated to the extraction and validation of statistical instantiations of the p-factor, called general factors of psychopathology. In this Perspective, we outline 5 major challenges in the p-factor literature, namely that it has: (1) mistakenly equated good model fit with validity; (2) sought to corroborate weak p-factor theories through underspecified construct validation efforts; (3) produced poorly replicated general factors of psychopathology; (4) violated assumptions of latent variable models; and (5) reified general factors of psychopathology as latent, causal entities, in turn neglecting alternative models that do not incorporate a p-factor and are entirely incompatible with the notion that a single dimension adequately summarizes variation in all forms of psychopathology. Each of these challenges raise questions about substantive interpretations of the p-factor (i.e., negative emotionality, thought disorder), undermining the field’s confidence that the p-factor is a real, latent entity, or that GFPs are useful summaries of psychopathology variation. We conclude with ways to move forward, in the spirit of strengthening the p-factor literature and improving our ability to classify, treat, and prevent psychopathology across the lifespan.},

  abstract = {Objective: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is increasingly being incorporated into intervention studies to acquire a more fine-grained and ecologically valid assessment of change, while minimizing recall bias relative to conventional retrospective self-report questionnaires. The added utility of including relatively burdensome EMA measures of change in a clinical trial hinges on several psychometric assumptions, including that these measure are: (1) reliable, (2) related but not redundant with conventional self-report measures (convergent and discriminant validity), (3) sensitive to intervention-related change, and (4) associated with a clinically-relevant criterion of patient improvement (criterion validity) above and beyond conventional self-report measures (incremental validity).  Methods: Using data from 4 trials (N = 412) of app-based meditation training we examined the reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of conventional self-report and EMA measures of improvement in rumination. Results: Conventional self-report and EMA measures of rumination were only modestly correlated, particularly with regards to change over time, which may be due at least in part to the substantially lower reliability of change scores. Larger changes in rumination were observed for the conventional self-report measures relative to EMA. Notably, change in both self-report and EMA rumination accounted for unique variance in overall depressive symptom improvement, demonstrating incremental predictive validity. Conclusions: Conventional self-report and EMA measures of rumination provide distinct and clinically meaningful information. Researchers using EMA should carefully consider the psychometric properties of their measures and the precise construct they intend to capture.},

  abstract = {The experience sampling method (ESM) has revolutionized our ability to conduct psychological research in the natural environment. However, researchers have a large degree of freedom when preprocessing ESM data, which may hinder scientific progress. This study illustrates the use of multiverse analyses regarding preprocessing choices related to data exclusion (i.e., based on various levels of compliance and exclusion of the first assessment day) and the calculation of constructs (i.e., composite scores calculated as the mean, median, or mode) by reanalyzing established group differences in negative affect, stress reactivity, and emotional inertia between individuals with and without psychosis. Data came from five studies and included 233 individuals with psychosis and 223 healthy individuals (in total, 26,892 longitudinal assessments). Preprocessing choices related to data exclusion did not affect conclusions. For both stress reactivity and emotional inertia of negative affect, group differences were affected when negative affect was calculated as the mean compared to the median or mode. Further analyses revealed that this could be attributed to considerable differences in the within- and between-factor structure of negative affect. While these findings show that observed differences in affective processes between individuals with and without psychosis are robust to preprocessing choices related to data exclusion, we found disagreement in conclusions between different central tendency measures. Safeguarding the validity of future experience sampling research, scholars are advised to use multiverse analysis to evaluate the robustness of their conclusions across different preprocessing scenarios.},

  abstract = {Unified structural equation modeling (uSEM) implemented in the group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME) framework has recently been widely used for characterizing within-person network dynamics of behavioral and functional neuroimaging variables. Previous studies have established that GIMME accurately recovers the presence of relations between variables. However, recovery of relation directionality is less consistent, which is concerning given the importance of directionality estimates for many research questions. There is evidence that strong autoregressive relations may aid directionality recovery and indirect evidence that a novel version of GIMME allowing for multiple solutions could improve recovery when such relations are weak, but it remains unclear how these strategies perform under a range of study conditions. Using comprehensive simulations that varied the strength of autoregressive relations among other factors, this study evaluated the directionality recovery of two GIMME search strategies: (a) estimating autoregressive relations by default in the null model (GIMME-AR) and (b) generating multiple solution paths (GIMME-MS). Both strategies recovered directionality best—and were roughly equivalent in performance—when autoregressive relations were strong (e.g., β = .60). When they were weak (β ≤ .10), GIMME-MS displayed an advantage, although overall directionality recovery was modest. Analyses of empirical data in which autoregressive relations were characteristically strong (resting state functional MRI) versus weak (daily diary) mirrored simulation results and confirmed that these strategies can disagree on directionality when autoregressive relations are weak. Findings have important implications for psychological and neuroimaging applications of uSEM/GIMME and suggest specific scenarios in which researchers might or might not be confident in directionality results.

  abstract = {Blended care, a combination of online and face-to-face therapy, is increasingly being applied in mental health care to obtain optimal benefit from the advantages these two treatment modalities have. Promising results have been reported, but a variety in descriptions and ways of operationalizing blended care exists. Currently, what type of \&\#8220;blend\&\#8221; works for whom, and why, is unclear. Furthermore, a rationale for setting up blended care is often lacking. In this viewpoint paper, we describe postulates for blended care and provide an instrument (Fit for Blended Care) that aims to assist therapists and patients whether and how to set up blended care treatment. A review of the literature, two focus groups (n=5 and n=5), interviews with therapists (n=14), and interviews with clients (n=2) were conducted to develop postulates of eHealth and blended care and an instrument to assist therapists and clients in setting up optimal blended care. Important postulates for blended care are the notion that both treatment modalities should complement each other and that set up of blended treatment should be based on shared decision making between patient and therapist. The \&\#8220;Fit for Blended Care\&\#8221; instrument is presented which addresses the following relevant themes: possible barriers to receiving blended treatment such as the risk of crisis, issues in communication (at a distance), as well as possible facilitators such as social support. More research into the reasons why and for whom blended care works is needed. To benefit from blended care, face-to-face and online care should be combined in such way that the potentials of both treatment modalities are used optimally, depending on patient abilities, needs, and preferences. To facilitate the process of setting up a personalized blended treatment, the Fit for Blended Care instrument can be used. By applying this approach in research and practice, more insight into the working mechanisms and optimal (personal) \&\#8220;blends\&\#8221; of online and face-to-face therapy becomes within reach.},

  abstract = {Methodical developments facilitated research on the time-dynamic nature of emotions, introducing novel emotion dynamic measures such as emotional inertia that initially showed significant associations with well-being outcomes like depressive symptoms. However, recent research has challenged this notion by demonstrating that negative emotion inertia’s explanatory power in predicting depressive symptoms vanished once mean negative emotion was controlled for. Emotional inertia is often modeled by a two-step approach that first derives estimates of emotional inertia and then uses those to predict depressive symptoms. In the present research, we reanalyzed five experience sampling data sets (N = 875 participants) and demonstrate that this two-step approach leads to low reliability of negative emotion inertia, r¯sb = .52; thereby, attenuating its association with depressive symptoms, as reflected by only 1.3\% added explained variance in depressive symptoms above mean negative emotion. As an alternative, we propose a novel one-step approach that adjusts for unreliability of inertia estimates: We introduce a latent inertia factor that is defined by the autocorrelation of various emotion items. Using dynamic structural equation models, this latent factor is simultaneously used to predict depressive symptoms. Here, negative emotion inertia showed good reliability, ω¯ = .81, and explained an additional 4.5\% of the total variance in depressive symptoms. Thus, our results demonstrate that emotion dynamic measures can be an important feature of individual well-being if their lower reliability compared with mean negative emotion is modeled and corrected for in dynamic structural equation models.

We aimed to confirm these relationships via actigraphic assessment in a large, population-based sample, and test whether sex moderates these relationships. Methods 418 participants (age 35–85, mean 57.04, SD = 11.47) completed questionnaires and one week of actigraphy, used to calculate sleep and rest-activity statistics including mesor (mean activity level), amplitude (height of rhythm), and acrophase (time of day that rhythm peaks). Results Depressive symptoms, assessed via Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), were associated with disrupted sleep and rest-activity rhythms. Furthermore, men demonstrated longer sleep onset latency (SOL; B = −13.28, p {$<$} .001), longer wake time after sleep onset (B = −6.26, p {$<$} .01), lower sleep efficiency (B = 5.91, p {$<$} .001), and lower total sleep time (TST; B = 33.16, p {$<$} .001) than women. Sex moderated the relationship between depression and SOL, TST, mesor, and amplitude; sex-stratified models revealed higher depression scores were associated with greater SOL (B = 1.05, p {$<$} .001) and less TST (B = −0.87, p {$<$} .10) for women with higher depressive symptoms, but lower mesor (B = −1.75, p {$<$} .01) and amplitude (B = −1.94, p {$<$} .01) for men with higher depressive symptoms. Conclusions Depressive symptoms were related to disrupted sleep continuity and rest-activity rhythms in this population-based sample; however, these relationships differed by sex.

This paper argues that the micro-level perspective can be used to identify the smallest building blocks underlying the onset and course of mental ill-health. Psychopathology may be the result of the continuous dynamic interplay between micro-level moment-to-moment experiences and behavioural patterns over time. Reinforcing loops between momentary states may alter the course of mental health towards either a more or less healthy state. An example with observed data, from a population of individuals with depressive symptoms, supports the validity of a dynamic network model of psychopathology and shows that together and over time, this continuous interplay between momentary states may result in the cluster of symptoms we call major depressive disorder. This approach may help conceptualize the nature of mental disorders, and generate individualized insights useful for diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry.},

  abstract = {Background: In complex systems early warning signals such as rising autocorrelation, variance and network connectivity are hypothesized to anticipate relevant shifts in a system. For direct evidence hereof in depression, designs are needed in which early warning signals and symptom transitions are prospectively assessed within an individual. Therefore, this study aimed to detect personalized early warning signals preceding the occurrence of a major symptom transition. Methods: Six singlesubject time-series studies were conducted, collecting frequent observations of momentary affective states during a time-period when participants were at increased risk of a symptom transition. Momentary affect states were reported three times a day over three to six months (95-183 days). Depressive symptoms were measured weekly using the Symptom CheckList-90. Presence of sudden symptom transitions was assessed using change point analysis. Early warning signals were analysed using moving window techniques. Results: As change point analysis revealed a significant and sudden symptom transition in one participant in the studied period, early warning signals were examined in this person. Autocorrelation (r=0·51; p{$<$}2.2e-16), and variance (r=0·53; p{$<$}2.2e-16) in ‘feeling down’, and network connectivity (r=0·42; p{$<$}2.2e-16) significantly increased a month before this transition occurred. These early warnings also preceded the rise in absolute levels of ‘feeling down’ and the participant’s personal indication of risk for transition. Conclusions: This study replicated the findings of a previous study and confirmed the presence of rising early warning signals a month before the symptom transition occurred. Results show the potential of early warning signals to improve personalized risk assessment in the field of psychiatry.},

  abstract = {The network theory of psychopathology proposes that mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. This theory provides a promising framework to understand the development and maintenance of mental disorders such as depression. In this narrative review, we summarize the literature on network studies in the field of depression. Four methodological network approaches are distinguished: (i) studies focusing on symptoms at the macro-level vs. (ii) on momentary states at the micro-level, and (iii) studies based on cross-sectional vs. (iv) time-series (dynamic) data. Fifty-six studies were identified. We found that different methodological approaches to network theory yielded largely inconsistent findings on depression. Centrality is a notable exception: the majority of studies identified either positive affect or anhedonia as central nodes. To aid future research in this field, we outline a novel complementary network theory, the momentary affect dynamics (MAD) network theory, to understand the development of depression. Furthermore, we provide directions for future research and discuss if and how networks might be used in clinical practice. We conclude that more empirical network studies are needed to determine whether the network theory of psychopathology can indeed enhance our understanding of the underlying structure of depression and advance clinical treatment.},

The current study examined the effects of physical activity on affective state. A primary and within-study replication sample was derived from twin pairs. METHODS: Female twins (n = 504) participated in an experience sampling method study at baseline. Positive and negative affective changes were examined before and following daily life increases in physical activity. Neuroticism was measured at baseline and depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and at each of four follow-up assessments. Diagnoses, derived by Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Health-IV axis I disorders, (A. P. A., 1994) were obtained at baseline. RESULTS: A significant increase in positive affect (PA) following the moment of increase in physical activity was replicated across both samples up to 180 min after physical activity. There was no effect of physical activity on negative affect (NA). Across the two samples, a history of fulfilling diagnostic criteria for depression at least once moderated the effect of physical activity on PA, in that the effect was lost more rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports a causal effect of physical activity on PA. However, people with past experience of clinical depression may benefit less from the PA-inducing effect of physical activity. These findings have implications for the use of physical exercise in clinical practice.},

This is accomplished by identifying non-zero relations in the inverse of the covariance matrix. In psychology the default estimation method uses ℓ1-regularization, where the accompanying inferences are restricted to frequentist objectives. Bayesian methods remain relatively uncommon in practice and methodological literatures. To date, they have not yet been used for estimation and inference in the psychological network literature. In this work, I introduce Bayesian methodology that is specifically designed for the most common psychological applications. The graphical structure is determined with posterior probabilities that can be used to assess conditional dependent and independent relations. Additional methods are provided for extending inference to specific aspects within- and between-networks, including partial correlation differences and Bayesian methodology to quantify network predictability. I first demonstrate that the decision rule based on posterior probabilities can be calibrated to the desired level of specificity. The proposed techniques are then demonstrated in several illustrative examples. The methods have been implemented in the R package BGGM.},

This allows for testing theoretical and clinical expectations in GGMs. The novel matrix-F prior distribution is described that provides increased flexibility in specification compared to the Wishart prior. The methods are applied to PTSD symptoms. In several applications, we demonstrate how the exploratory and confirmatory approaches can work in tandem: hypotheses are formulated from an initial analysis and then tested in an independent dataset.

  abstract = {Gaussian graphical models are commonly used to characterize conditional independence structures (i.e., networks) of psychological constructs. Recently attention has shifted from estimating single networks to those from various sub-populations. The focus is primarily to detect differences or demonstrate replicability. We introduce two novel Bayesian methods for comparing networks that explicitly address these aims. The first is based on the posterior predictive distribution, with a symmetric version of Kullback-Leibler divergence as the discrepancy measure, that tests differences between two multivariate normal distributions. The second approach makes use of Bayesian model comparison, with the Bayes factor, and allows for gaining evidence for invariant network structures. This overcomes limitations of current approaches in the literature that use classical hypothesis testing, where it is only possible to determine whether groups are significantly different from each other. With simulation we show the posterior predictive method is approximately calibrated under the null hypothesis (α = 0.05) and has more power to detect differences than alternative approaches. We then examine the necessary sample sizes for detecting invariant network structures with Bayesian hypothesis testing, in addition to how this is influenced by the choice of prior distribution. The methods are applied to post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms that were measured in four groups. We end by summarizing our major contribution, that is proposing two novel methods for comparing GGMs, which extends beyond the social-behavioral sciences.

Due to the nature of the \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$-penalty, however, bootstrapping does not provide an accurate sampling distribution. Although this has long been known in the statistical literature, I set out to determine whether the intervals can at least be considered \textbackslash emph\{approximate\}. In multiple regression, I first describe the fundamental tension between model selection and estimation consistency inherent to the \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$-penalty---in the pursuit of sparsity, the sampling distribution of the non-zero coefficients is necessarily compromised which translates into coverage far below nominal levels. With the foundation laid, I proceed to investigate coverage for non-zero relations in partial correlation networks. At best, average coverage was around 0.65 for 90\textbackslash\% CIs. With increasing sample sizes, average coverage decreased to 0.30, perhaps approaching 0 if larger sample sizes were explored. Further, coverage was heavily influenced by the mere position of an edge in the network, ranging from essentially 0 to 0.90, with an average of around 0.50. Meanwhile, for the same simulation conditions, simply bootstrapping the sample covariance matrix provided coverage at the nominal level. In light of the results, I then demonstrate how to judiciously use the bootstrap in both regularized and non-regularized networks: the former can provide a useful summary of data-mining, whereas the latter allows for making inference on network parameters. To ensure network researchers have the option of computing valid CIs, I implemented a non-regularized bootstrap for various types of partial correlations in the \{\textbackslash tt R\} package \textbackslash textbf\{GGMnonreg\}.},

Although methodological practice (e.g., p-hacking) has been identified as a root cause of unreliable research findings in psychological science, the statistical model itself has come under attack in the partial correlation network literature. In a motivating example, I first describe how sampling variability inherent to partial correlations can merely give the appearance of unreliability. For example, when going from zero-order to partial correlations there is necessarily more sampling variability that translates into reduced statistical power. I then introduce novel methodology for deriving expected network replicability (ENR), wherein replication is modeled with the Poisson-binomial distribution. This analytic solution can be used with the Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, and polychoric partial correlation coefficient. I first employed the method to estimate ENR for a variety of data sets from the network literature. Here it was determined that partial correlation networks do not have inherent limitations, given current estimates of replicability were consistent with ENR. I then highlighted sources that can reduce replicability, that is, when going from continuous to ordinal data with few categories and employing a multiple comparisons correction. To address these challenges, I described a strategy for using the proposed method to plan for network replication. I end with recommendations that include the importance of the network literature repositioning itself with gold-standard approaches for assessing replication, including explicit consideration of Type I and Type II error rates. The method for computing ENR is implemented in the R package GGMnonreg. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {An important goal for psychological science is developing methods to characterize relationships between variables. Customary approaches use structural equation models to connect latent factors to a number of observed measurements, or test causal hypotheses between observed variables. More recently, regularized partial correlation networks have been proposed as an alternative approach for characterizing relationships among variables through covariances in the precision matrix. While the graphical lasso (glasso) has emerged as the default network estimation method, it was optimized in fields outside of psychology with very different needs, such as high dimensional data where the number of variables (p) exceeds the number of observations (n). In this paper, we describe the glasso method in the context of the fields where it was developed, and then we demonstrate that the advantages of regularization diminish in settings where psychological networks are often fitted (p ≪ n). We first show that improved properties of the precision matrix, such as eigenvalue estimation, and predictive accuracy with cross-validation are not always appreciable. We then introduce non-regularized methods based on multiple regression and a non-parametric bootstrap strategy, after which we characterize performance with extensive simulations. Our results demonstrate that the non-regularized methods can be used to reduce the false positive rate, compared to glasso, and they appear to provide consistent performance across sparsity levels, sample composition (p/n), and partial correlation size. We end by reviewing recent findings in the statistics literature that suggest alternative methods often have superior performance than glasso, as well as suggesting areas for future research in psychology.

In these cases, the proportion of between-variance to total-variance (i.e., the sum between-variance and within-variance) is of special importance and usually estimated by the intraclass coefficient (1)1 [ICC(1)]. Our contribution firstly shows via mathematical proof that measurement error increases the within-variance, which in turn decreases the ICC(1). Further, we provide a numerical example, and examine the RMSEs, alpha error rates and the inclusion of zero in the confidence intervals for ICC(1) estimation with and without measurement error. Secondly, we propose two corrections [i.e., the reliability-adjusted ICC(1) and the measurement model-based ICC(1)] that yield correct estimates for the ICC(1), and prove that they are unaffected by measurement error mathematically. Finally, we discuss our findings, point out examples of the underestimation of the ICC(1) in the literature, and reinterpret the results of these examples in the light of our new estimator. We also illustrate the potential application of our work to other ICCs. Finally, we conclude that measurement error distorts the ICC(1) to a non-negligible extent.},

  abstract = {The quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in terms of conditional entropy and mutual information, respectively, has recently become quite common in machine learning. While the properties of these measures, which are rooted in information theory, seem appealing at first glance, we identify various incoherencies that call their appropriateness into question. In addition to the measures themselves, we critically discuss the idea of an additive decomposition of total uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic constituents. Experiments across different computer vision tasks support our theoretical findings and raise concerns about current practice in uncertainty quantification.},

We aimed to explore the dynamic relationship between symptomatology, functioning and deliberate self-harm (DSH) and evaluate the feasibility of developing a self-harm risk prediction tool for patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES).Patients with FES (n = 1234) were followed up for 36 months. Symptomatology, functioning, treatment adherence and self-harm information were obtained monthly over the follow-up period. A time-varying vector autoregressive (VAR) model was used to study the contribution of clinical variables to self-harm over the 36th month. Random forest models for self-harm were established to classify the individuals with self-harm and predict future self-harm events.Over a 36-month period, 187 patients with FES had one or more self-harm events. The depressive symptoms contributed the most to self-harm prediction during the first year, while the importance of positive psychotic symptoms increased from the second year onwards. The random forest model with all static information and symptom instability achieved a good area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC = 0.77 ± 0.023) for identifying patients with DSH. With a sliding window analysis, the averaged AUROC of predicting a self-event was 0.65 ± 0.102 (ranging from 0.54 to 0.78) with the best model being 6-month predicted future 6-month self-harm for month 11–23 (AUROC = 0.7).Results highlight the importance of the dynamic relationship of depressive and positive psychotic symptoms with self-harm and the possibility of self-harm prediction in FES with longitudinal clinical data.},

  abstract = {Personalized prediction is a machine learning approach that predicts a person's future observations based on their past labeled observations and is typically used for sequential tasks, e.g., to predict daily mood ratings. When making personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends: (a) trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happier on weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specific trends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popular statistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic and person-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gaining popularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, these integrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters: ruling out nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural Mixed Effect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywhere in a neural network in a scalable manner. NME combines the efficiency of neural network optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, we observe that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodal datasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and a mother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half the mothers experience at least moderate symptoms of depression. Furthermore, we evaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditional random fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learns nonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states. Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent dataset shows interpretable trends related to the mother's depression symptoms.},

Ambulatory assessment techniques promise to revolutionize assessment practices by allowing access to the dynamic data necessary to study these processes directly. Assessing manifestations of personality and psychopathology naturalistically in an individual’s own ecology allows for dynamic modeling of key behavioral processes. However, advances in dynamic data collection have highlighted the challenges of both fully understanding an individual (via idiographic models) and how s/he compares with others (as seen in nomothetic models). Methods are needed that can simultaneously model idiographic (i.e., person-specific) processes and nomothetic (i.e., general) structure from intensive longitudinal personality assessments. Here we present a method, group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME) for simultaneously studying general, shared (i.e., in subgroups), and person-specific processes in intensive longitudinal behavioral data. We first provide an introduction to the GIMME method, followed by a demonstration of its use in a sample of individuals diagnosed with personality disorder who completed daily diaries over 100 consecutive days.

To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the naturalistic manifestation of personality pathology over the course of 100 days. A group of individuals (N=101) diagnosed with any personality disorder (PD) completed a daily diary study over 100 consecutive days (Mdn = 94 days, Range = 33–101 days). Participants completed daily ratings of 30 manifestations of personality pathology. Patterns of stability and variability over the course of the study were then examined. Results indicated that individual PD manifestations and domains of PD manifestations were variable across days and differed widely in their frequency. Additionally, individual averages and level of variability in PD domains were highly stable across months, individual averages of PD domains were predicted by baseline dispositional ratings of PD traits with a high degree of specificity, and daily variability PD domains was associated with elevated levels of PD traits. This pattern of findings suggests that dynamic processes of symptom exacerbation and diminution that are stable in mean level and variability in expression over time characterizes personality pathology. Further, dispositional ratings are significant predictors of average daily expression of PD features., The general definition of personality disorders includes descriptors of the relative stability in their expression (e.g., “enduring,” “pervasive,” “inflexible”). This naturalistic daily diary study shows that personality disorders are, in fact, a combination of stability and variability in their expression.},

The results showed that on average EMA studies scheduled six assessments per day, lasted for seven days, and obtained a compliance of 79\%. Studies with more assessments per day scheduled fewer assessment days, yet, the number of assessments did not predict compliance or dropout rates. Compliance was significantly higher in studies providing financial incentives. Otherwise, design or sample characteristics had little effects.

  abstract = {Large-scale surveys are common in social and behavioral science research. Missing data often occur at item levels due to nonresponses or planned missing data designs. In practice, the item scores are typically aggregated into scale scores (i.e., sum or mean scores) for further analyses. Although several strategies to handle item-level missing data have been proposed, most of them are not easy to implement, especially for applied researchers. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we examined a practical hybrid approach to deal with item-level missing data in Likert scale items with a varying number of categories (i.e., four, five, and seven) and missing data mechanisms. Specifically, the examined approach first uses proration to calculate the scale scores for a participant if a certain proportion of item scores is available (a cutoff criterion of proration) and then use full information maximum likelihood to deal with missing data at the scale level when scale scores cannot be computed due to the selected proration cutoff criterion. Our simulation results showed that the hybrid approach was generally acceptable when the missing data were randomly spread over the items, even when they had different thresholds/means and loadings, with caution to be taken when the missingness is determined by one of the scale items. Based on the results, we recommend using the cutoff of 30\% or 40\% for proration when the sample size is small and the cutoff of 40\% or 50\% when the sample size is moderate or large.},

This approach utilizes the relative entropy (RE) to resolve possible problems in the original PPMC procedure based on the posterior predictive p-value (PPP-value). Compared with the typical conservatism of PPP-value, the RE value measures the discrepancy effectively. Simulated and real data sets with different item numbers, degree of sparseness, sample sizes, and factor dimensions are studied to investigate the performance of the proposed method. The estimates of univariate information and difficulty parameters are found to be robust with dual characteristics, which produce practical implications for educational testing. Compared with parametric bootstrapping, RE–PPMC is much more capable of evaluating the model adequacy.},

  abstract = {Positive psychology, referred to by some as a “fifth force” in psychology, has claimed that its offerings can contribute to the building of a “good life” and a “moral society.” Its methods in achieving this goal appear to include not only active denial of systemic and institutionalized forms of oppression or rationalizing oppression as a positive force, but also judgment of feelings, experiences, and actions that are central to addressing prejudice and social violence. Suffering is presented as a failure of self-control. Moreover, positive psychology, like other dominant forms of Western psychology throughout its history, legitimize themselves through scientism, which embraces supposedly “value-neutral” empiricism including exclusively natural science/quantitative designs, evolutionary psychology, a biological focus, and experimentation on animals. Special attention is given to how positive psychology is communicated to the public through popular publications, and how a mono-emotional approach to human experience is produced by and supports monocultural social structures.},

  abstract = {“Positive” psychology has gained a dominant voice within and outside the field of psychology. Although critiques of this perspective have been rendered, including by humanistic psychologists, psychology scholars have offered minimum space for critical reflections of this movement in contrast to its critiques existing inside and outside the academia in other fields. Therefore, this contribution seeks to explicate emerging systematic critiques of positive psychology by scholars and practitioners from within mental health fields as well as from philosophy, medicine, education, business, and cultural studies and to highlight sociocultural discussions of positive movement by the culture critics. Last, we offer reflections on positive psychology as immigrant professionals from non-Western backgrounds with an emphasis on existential and humanities-based perspectives. We also highlight that the tenets and experiments based on “positive” psychological practices may have especially detrimental effect on marginalized individuals and communities. This contribution seeks to invite a critical dialogue in the field regarding positive psychology within and outside humanistic psychology and psychology in general.},

  abstract = {Background Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating mood disorder. Individuals with MDD are often misdiagnosed or diagnosed in an untimely manner, exacerbating existing functional impairments. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves the repeated sampling of an individual's symptoms within their natural environment and has been demonstrated to assist in illness assessment and characterization. Capturing data in this way would set the stage for improved treatment outcomes and serve as a complementary resource in the management and treatment of depressive symptoms. Methods Online databases PubMed/MedLine and PsycINFO were searched using PRISMA guidelines and combinations of the following keywords: EMA, depression, smartphone app, diagnosing, symptoms, phone, app, ecological momentary assessment, momentary assessment, data mining, unobtrusive, passive data, GPS, sensor. Results A total of nineteen original articles were identified using our search parameters and ten articles met the inclusion criteria for full-text review. Among the ten relevant studies, three studies evaluated feasibility, seven evaluated detection, and three evaluated treatment of MDD. Limitations Limitations include that the design of all of the studies included in this review are non-randomized. It should be noted that most of the studies included were pilot studies and/or exploratory trials lacking a control group. Conclusions Available evidence suggests that the use of passive smartphone-based applications may lead to improved management of depressive symptoms. This review aids the creation of new EMA applications, highlights the potential of EMA usage in clinical settings and drug development, emphasizes the importance for regulation of applications in the mental health field, and provides insight into future directions.},

This study focused on penalized regression, a procedure that builds interpretive prediction models among machine learning methods. In particular, penalized regression coupled with large-scale data can explore hundreds or thousands of variables in one statistical model without convergence problems and identify yet uninvestigated important predictors. As one of the first Monte Carlo simulation studies to investigate predictive modeling with missing categorical predictors in the context of social science research, this study endeavored to emulate real social science large-scale data. Likert-scaled variables were simulated as well as multiple-category and count variables. Due to the inclusion of the categorical predictors in modeling, penalized regression methods that consider the grouping effect were employed such as group Mnet. We also examined the applicability of the simulation conditions with a real large-scale dataset that the simulation study referenced. Particularly, the study presented selection counts of variables after multiple iterations of modeling in order to consider the bias resulting from data-splitting in model validation. Selection counts turned out to be a necessary tool when variable selection is of research interest. Efforts to utilize large-scale data to the fullest appear to offer a valid approach to mitigate the effect of nonignorable missingness. Overall, penalized regression which assumes linearity is a viable method to analyze social science large-scale survey data.},

In this study, we examined the effects of group size differences on results of factorial invariance tests, proposed a subsampling method to address unbalanced sample size issue in factorial invariance studies, and evaluated the proposed approach in various simulation conditions. Our findings confirm that violations of invariance might be masked in the case of severely unbalanced group size conditions and support the use of the proposed subsampling method to obtain accurate results for invariance studies.},

  abstract = {Inflammation is a natural defence response of the immune system against environmental insult, stress and injury, but hyper- and hypo-inflammatory responses can trigger diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation is involved in multiple psychiatric disorders. Using inflammation-related factors as biomarkers of psychiatric disorders requires the proof of reproducibility and specificity of the changes in different disorders, which remains to be established. We performed a cross-disorder study by systematically evaluating the meta-analysis results of inflammation-related factors in eight major psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depression disorder (MDD), post-trauma stress disorder (PTSD), sleeping disorder (SD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and suicide. A total of 43 meta-analyses involving 704 publications on 44 inflammation-related factors were included in the study. We calculated the effect size and statistical power for every inflammation-related factor in each disorder. Our analyses showed that well-powered case–control studies provided more consistent results than underpowered studies when one factor was meta-analysed by different researchers. After removing underpowered studies, 30 of the 44 inflammation-related factors showed significant alterations in at least one disorder based on well-powered meta-analyses. Eleven of them changed in patients of more than two disorders when compared with the controls. A few inflammation-related factors showed unique changes in specific disorders (e.g., IL-4 increased in BD, decreased in suicide, but had no change in MDD, ASD, PTSD and SCZ). MDD had the largest number of changes while SD has the least. Clustering analysis showed that closely related disorders share similar patterns of inflammatory changes, as genome-wide genetic studies have found. According to the effect size obtained from the meta-analyses, 13 inflammation-related factors would need {$<$}50 cases and 50 controls to achieve 80\% power to show significant differences (p\,{$<$}\,0.0016) between patients and controls. Changes in different states of MDD, SCZ or BD were also observed in various comparisons. Studies comparing first-episode SCZ to controls may have more reproducible findings than those comparing pre- and post-treatment results. Longitudinal, system-wide studies of inflammation regulation that can differentiate trait- and state-specific changes will be needed to establish valuable biomarkers.},

Both have been used in psychometric research to detect aberrant responses in a response sequence, e.g., test speededness, inattentiveness, or cheating. However, the pros and cons of CUSUM and CPA in different testing settings still remain unclear. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of the performance of twelve CUSUM-based statistics and three CPA-based procedures in detecting test speededness. Two speededness mechanisms are considered, namely the graduate change model (GCM) and the hybrid model (HM), to test the robustness and flexibility of the two methods. Simulation studies show that the performances of the statistics are affected by the underlying data generating model, the severity of speededness, and the test length. Generally, under HM some CUSUM statistics perform much better than the CPA-based statistics. Under the GCM, the performance of the CPA statistics is dramatically improved. Taken together, due to the unknown mechanism of speededness in real applications, two CUSUM-based statistics are recommended when the test length is long (e.g., 80 items), regardless of the underlying mechanism being HM or GCM. In a relatively short (e.g., 40 items) or medium-length (e.g., 60 items) test, no statistic always ends up in the top three under both HM and GCM. In those cases, either one of the two CUSUM-based statistics mentioned above can be a reasonable choice because of their good (though not necessarily the best) performance in a wide range of conditions.},

  abstract = {While probabilistic circuits have been extensively explored for tabular data, less attention has been paid to time series. Here, the goal is to estimate joint densities among the entire time series and, in turn, determining, for instance, conditional independence relations between them. To this end, we propose the first probabilistic circuits (PCs) approach for modeling the joint distribution of multivariate time series, called Whittle sum-product networks (WSPNs). WSPNs leverage the Whittle approximation, casting the likelihood in the frequency domain, and place a complex-valued sum-product network, the most prominent PC, over the frequencies. The conditional independence relations among the time series can then be determined efficiently in the spectral domain. Moreover, WSPNs can naturally be placed into the deep neural learning stack for time series, resulting in Whittle Networks, opening the likelihood toolbox for training deep neural models and inspecting their behaviour. Our experiments show that Whittle Networks can indeed capture complex dependencies between time series and provide a useful measure of uncertainty for neural networks.},

  abstract = {We develop a Bayesian group-based trajectory model (GBTM) and extend it to incorporate dual trajectories and Bayesian model averaging for model selection. Our framework lends itself to many of the standard distributions used in GBTMs, including normal, censored normal, binary, and ordered outcomes. On the model selection front, GBTMs require the researcher to specify a functional relationship between time and the outcome within each latent group. These relationships are generally polynomials with varying degrees in each group, but can also include additional covariates or other functions of time. When the number of groups is large, the model space can grow prohibitively complex, requiring a time-consuming brute-force search over potentially thousands of models. The approach developed in this article requires just one model fit and has the additional advantage of accounting for uncertainty in model selection.

Methods PubMed and Web of Science updated on October 22, 2014 were searched for eligible publications.

Results Seven prospective studies were included, involving 25,271 participants for short sleep duration and 23,663 participants for long sleep duration. Compared with the normal sleep duration, the pooled RR for depression was 1.31 (95\% CI, 1.04–1.64; I2 = 0\%) for the short sleep duration overall. For long sleep duration, the pooled RR was 1.42 (95\% CI, 1.04–1.92; I2 = 0\%). The associations between short or long sleep duration and risk of depression did not substantially change in sensitivity and subgroup analyses. No evidence of publication bias was found. Conclusion This meta-analysis indicates that short and long sleep duration was significantly associated with increased risk of depression in adults.},

A primary issue that challenges this task is the myriad of subtle factors that could have contributed to the observed heterogeneity. We leveraged the recent advances in theoretical machine learning to develop a novel latent mixture-based method for disentangling effect-size heterogeneity in meta-analysis. Mathematical analysis and simulation studies were carried out to demonstrate that, when the observed heterogeneity stems from more than 1 factor, our method can attain a substantially higher statistical power than the traditional methods for moderator analysis without requiring researchers to make judgment calls on which factors to consider or correct for in analyzing the observed heterogeneity. We also conducted a case study with real-world data to show how our method may be used to address long-standing inconsistencies in the literature.

  abstract = {The central limit theorem (CLT) is one of the most important theorems in statistics, and it is often introduced to social sciences researchers in an introductory statistics course. However, the recent replication crisis in the social sciences prompts us to investigate just how common certain misconceptions of statistical concepts are. The main purposes of this article are to investigate the misconceptions of the CLT among social sciences researchers and to address these misconceptions by clarifying the definition and properties of the CLT in a manner that is approachable to social science researchers. As part of our article, we conducted a survey to examine the misconceptions of the CLT among graduate students and researchers in the social sciences. We found that the most common misconception of the CLT is that researchers think the CLT is about the convergence of sample data to the normal distribution. We also found that most researchers did not realize that the CLT applies to both sample means and sample sums, and that the CLT has implications for many common statistical concepts and techniques. Our article addresses these misconceptions of the CLT by explaining the preliminaries needed to understand the CLT, introducing the formal definition of the CLT, and elaborating on the implications of the CLT. We hope that through this article, researchers can obtain a more accurate and nuanced understanding of how the CLT operates as well as its role in a variety of statistical concepts and techniques.

Here, we show that this can lead to sizable misperceptions about the implications of scientific results. Specifically, we present three preregistered, randomized experiments where participants saw the same scientific findings visualized as showing only inferential uncertainty, only outcome variability, or both and answered questions about the size and importance of findings they were shown. Our results, composed of responses from medical professionals, professional data scientists, and tenure-track faculty, show that the prevalent form of visualizing only inferential uncertainty can lead to significant overestimates of treatment effects, even among highly trained experts. In contrast, we find that depicting both inferential uncertainty and outcome variability leads to more accurate perceptions of results while appearing to leave other subjective impressions of the results unchanged, on average.},

In standard PPMC procedures, model misfit is quantified by compar­ ing the location of an ML-based point estimate to the predictive distribution of a statistic. When the point estimate is far from the center posterior predictive distribution, model fit is poor. Not included in this approach, however, is the variability of the Maximum Likelihood (ML)-based point estimates. We propose a new method of PPMC based on comparing posterior predictive distributions of a hypothesized and saturated BCFA model. The method uses the predictive distribution of the saturated model as a reference and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic to quantify the local misfit of hypothesized models. The results of the simulation study suggest that the saturated model PPMC approach was an accurate method of determining local model misfit and could be used for model comparison.

  abstract = {Background: Research in mental health has found associations between depression and individuals’ behaviors and statuses, such as social connections and interactions, working status, mobility, and social isolation and loneliness. These behaviors and statuses can be approximated by the nearby Bluetooth device count (NBDC) detected by Bluetooth sensors in mobile phones. Objective: This study aimed to explore the value of the NBDC data in predicting depressive symptom severity as measured via the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Methods: The data used in this paper included 2886 biweekly PHQ-8 records collected from 316 participants recruited from three study sites in the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom as part of the EU Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) study. From the NBDC data 2 weeks prior to each PHQ-8 score, we extracted 49 Bluetooth features, including statistical features and nonlinear features for measuring the periodicity and regularity of individuals’ life rhythms. Linear mixed-effect models were used to explore associations between Bluetooth features and the PHQ-8 score. We then applied hierarchical Bayesian linear regression models to predict the PHQ-8 score from the extracted Bluetooth features. Results: A number of significant associations were found between Bluetooth features and depressive symptom severity. Generally speaking, along with depressive symptom worsening, one or more of the following changes were found in the preceding 2 weeks of the NBDC data: (1) the amount decreased, (2) the variance decreased, (3) the periodicity (especially the circadian rhythm) decreased, and (4) the NBDC sequence became more irregular. Compared with commonly used machine learning models, the proposed hierarchical Bayesian linear regression model achieved the best prediction metrics (R2=0.526) and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.891. Bluetooth features can explain an extra 18.8\% of the variance in the PHQ-8 score relative to the baseline model without Bluetooth features (R2=0.338, RMSE=4.547). Conclusions: Our statistical results indicate that the NBDC data have the potential to reflect changes in individuals’ behaviors and statuses concurrent with the changes in the depressive state. The prediction results demonstrate that the NBDC data have a significant value in predicting depressive symptom severity. These findings may have utility for the mental health monitoring practice in real-world settings.},

  abstract = {Seasonality patterns are reported in various psychiatric disorders. The current paper summarizes findings on brain adaptations associated with seasonal changes, factors that contribute to individual differences and their implications for psychiatric disorders. Changes in circadian rhythms are likely to prominently mediate these seasonal effects since light strongly entrains the internal clock modifying brain function. Inability of circadian rhythms to accommodate to seasonal changes might increase the risk for mood and behavior problems as well as worse clinical outcomes in psychiatric disorders. Understanding the mechanisms that account for inter-individual variations in seasonality is relevant to the development of individualized prevention and treatment for psychiatric disorders. Despite promising findings, seasonal effects are still understudied and only controlled as a covariate in most brain research. Rigorous neuroimaging studies with thoughtful experimental designs, powered sample sizes and high temporal resolution alongside deep characterization of the environment are needed to better understand the seasonal adaptions of the human brain as a function of age, sex, and geographic latitude and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the alterations in seasonal adaptation in psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Scientific evidence in the field of psychiatry is mainly derived from group-based (‘nomothetic’) studies that yield group-aggregated results, while often the need is to answer questions that apply to individuals. Particularly in the presence of great inter-individual differences and temporal complexities, information at the individual-person level may be valuable for personalized treatment decisions, individual predictions and diagnostics. The single-subject study design can be used to make inferences about individual persons. Yet, the single-subject study is not often used in the field of psychiatry. We believe that this is because of a lack of awareness of its value rather than a lack of usefulness or feasibility. In the present paper, we aimed to resolve some common misconceptions and beliefs about single-subject studies by discussing some commonly heard ‘facts and fictions’. We also discuss some situations in which the single-subject study is more or less appropriate, and the potential of combining single-subject and group-based study designs into one study. While not intending to plea for single-subject studies at the expense of group-based studies, we hope to increase awareness of the value of single-subject research by informing the reader about several aspects of this design, resolving misunderstanding, and providing references for further reading.},

  abstract = {Background: We recently showed in a randomized controlled trial that Web-based self-help as an adjunct improved the effectiveness of multimodal inpatient psychotherapy for depression. Objective: The aims of this study were (1) to determine whether a Web-based self-help adjunctive to multimodal inpatient psychotherapeutic treatment could also improve the course of depressive symptoms and (2) to identify predictors of residual depressive symptoms at follow-up. Methods: Overall, 229 patients were randomized either to the Web-based self-help intervention group (IG; Deprexis) or an active control group (CG; Web-based information about depression and depressive symptoms) in addition to multimodal inpatient psychotherapy. Participants in both groups were able to access their respective Web-based programs for 12 weeks, which meant that they typically had access after discharge from the inpatient unit (mean hospitalization duration: 40 days, T1). Follow-up was performed 6 months after study intake (T3). Results: At follow-up, participants of the Web-based self-help group had considerably lower symptom load regarding depressive symptoms (d=0.58) and anxiety (d=0.46) as well as a better quality of life (d=0.43) and self-esteem (d=0.31) than participants of the CG. Nearly 3 times as many participants of the IG compared with the CG achieved remission in accordance with less deterioration. The number needed to treat based on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) improved over time (T1: 7.84, T2: 7.09, and T3: 5.12). Significant outcome predictors were BDI at discharge and treatment group. Conclusions: Web-based self-help as an add-on to multimodal inpatient psychotherapy improved the short-term course of depressive symptoms beyond termination. Residual symptoms at discharge from inpatient treatment and utilization of the Web-based self-help were the major predictors of depressive symptoms at follow-up. Challenges and barriers (eg, costs, therapists’ concerns, or technical barriers) of adding Web-based interventions to inpatient treatment have to be addressed.
