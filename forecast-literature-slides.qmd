## Why talk about this topic?

### Critical statisticians

-   We should be looking for the true model!

-   Maybe you do not know how to model with ARIMA...

-   

    > I suspect it is more likely to depend on the skill of the analyst … these authors are more at home with simple procedures than with Box-Jenkins. (Chatfield)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Makridakis & Hibon (1979)

-   Our Empirical evidence disagrees <br/><br/>

-   Of course we do <br/> <br/>

-   

    > might be useful for Dr Chatfield to read some of the psychological literature quoted in the main paper, and he can then learn a little more about biases

- The M5 uncertainty competition: Results, findings and conclusions TODO



## Utility and Issues with Competitions

-   Utility
    -   Empirical evidence
    -   Benchmarking
    -   Methodological development and cumulative science
    
-   Issues
    -   somewhat arbitrary conditions
    -   vibe-based analysis of results [@koning2005]
    -   Generalizability is questionable


-   Fildes Forecasting competitions

# Model Uncertainty and Combination {background-color="#40666e"}

## Search for the true model?

damn

## The beauty of simple models

Test stuff [@wang2023]

this

## Relevance for psychology

-   Model uncertainty is often neglected, both in inferential and predictive modeling [@kaplanQuantificationModelUncertainty2021]
-   Current predictive literature often seems to neglect model uncertainty
-   Theoretically linked to the complex systems literature

# Probabilistic Forecasting {background-color="#40666e"}

## Moving towards probabilistic forecasting

Weather forecasting used probabilistic forecasting surprisingly early:

> The probability of rain was much smaller than at other times (Dalton, 1793)

Popularized by Epstein 1969 Stochastic dynamic prediction

::: aside
Based on [@murphyEarlyHistoryProbability1998]
:::

## Proper representation of uncertainty

-   what is even meant here?
-   show plot by gneiting in the appendix
-   show different forms

## Probabilistic forecasting methods

-   explain basic ideas: go beyond probability of binary events

## Communicating uncertainty

https://www.weather.gov/mrx/probeducation

## Relevance for psychology

-   Practically linked to decision theory, e.g., for JITAIs

-   Highly relevant in healthcare

# Mixed Models {background-color="#40666e"}

## Extending mixed models

-   not 'forecasting' literature, but ML more broadly
-   use of random effects in machine learning has gained attention

::: callout-tip
## Flexible Mixed Model Formulation

From

$$
y = X\beta + Z\upsilon + \epsilon
$$

to

$$y = ml_{fixed}(X)+Z\upsilon + \epsilon$$[@kilian2023]
:::

## Relevance for Psychology

-   Improving on what we already have
-   Lots of flexibility
-   For example:
    -   lasso with random effects
    -   random forest/trees with random effects
    -   boosting with random effects
    -   ...

# Issues

## Methodolgical Issues in the Forecasting Literature

-   Reproducibility Issues (Boylan)
-   'Winner takes it all'? (see [@strobl2021])
